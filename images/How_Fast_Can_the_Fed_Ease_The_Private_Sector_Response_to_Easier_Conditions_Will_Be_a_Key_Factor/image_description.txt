The provided chart displays two key economic indicators from 1970 to around 2023: Private Sector Credit Creation (as a percentage of GDP) represented by the blue line, and Slack, represented by the red line. 

Here is a succinct summary:

1. **Private Sector Credit Creation (%GDP):**
   - This metric highlights the proportion of new credit extended to the private sector relative to GDP. It has experienced several cycles of highs and lows over the observed period. 
   - Recent data shows a notable decline, reaching unusually low levels for the current stage of economic expansion.

2. **Slack:**
   - Slack (an economic term often referring to underused resources in the economy such as labor or capital) has also gone through several fluctuations.
   - Recent trends indicate an increase in slack.

3. **Current Economic Condition:**
   - The chart indicates an unusual economic condition where borrowing by the private sector is low and decreasing, despite being in the expansion phase of the economic cycle. This phase is typically characterized by increased borrowing and investment, making the current scenario atypical.

Overall, the highlighted region on the chart suggests a divergence between usual economic expectations and current private sector borrowing behavior, which could indicate underlying economic issues that merit further analysis.
