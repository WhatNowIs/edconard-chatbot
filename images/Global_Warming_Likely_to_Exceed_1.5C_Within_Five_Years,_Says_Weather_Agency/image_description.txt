The image presents data on global annual mean temperature anomalies compared to the 1850-1900 baseline, measured in degrees Celsius. The graph highlights key predictions and historical temperature trends:

1. **Temperature Trends**:
   - From 1860 to the present, global temperatures have shown an overall rising trend, with more significant increases in recent decades.
   - There have been periodic fluctuations in temperature anomalies, but the overall trajectory is upward.

2. **Key Predictions (2023-2027)**:
   - There is a 66% chance that global temperatures could temporarily exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels in at least one year between 2023 and 2027. Temperatures could potentially reach up to 1.8°C above these levels.
   - There is a 98% chance that within the next five years, at least one year will surpass the record high temperature anomaly of 1.28°C, which was recorded in 2016.

3. **Visualized Thresholds**:
   - A dashed line at 1.5°C marks the threshold many climate agreements aim to avoid surpassing.
   - The temperature anomalies are plotted on a vertical scale ranging from -0.5°C to 1.5°C, alongside a timeline from 1860 to the present.

4. **Source and Dataset**:
   - The data is sourced from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and is based on the HadCRUT5 dataset analysis.

This summary underscores the likelihood of significant global warming events in the near future, highlighting the urgency of climate change mitigation efforts.
