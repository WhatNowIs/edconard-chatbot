The provided chart breaks down labor productivity growth into three components—Total Factor Productivity (TFP), Capital/Output, and Labour Composition—across three time periods (1980-1995, 1995-2007, 2007-2019) for six regions/countries: the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), Germany (DU), France (FRA), and a combination of Italy and Spain (ITA/ESP).

### Summary:

#### Time Period: 1980–1995
- **US**: TFP was the primary driver of productivity growth, followed by Labour Composition, with a smaller contribution from Capital/Output.
- **UK**: Significant TFP contributions, sizable Capital/Output contributions, and modest Labour Composition contributions.
- **Germany (DU)**: Highest contributions from TFP, but Capital/Output and Labour Composition had notable shares.
- **France (FRA)**: Similar pattern to Germany with strong TFP contribution.
- **Italy/Spain (ITA/ESP)**: Higher contributions from Capital/Output than other regions, but TFP still the main factor.

#### Time Period: 1995–2007
- **US**: TFP was still the largest contributor, but all components had about equal contributions.
- **UK**: TFP remained dominant, with Labour Composition also contributing significantly.
- **Germany (DU)**: Consistent high contribution from TFP and substantial input from Capital/Output.
- **France (FRA)** and **Italy/Spain (ITA/ESP)**: Continued strong TFP contributions and noticeable contributions from Capital/Output.

#### Time Period: 2007–2019
- **US**: Marked reduction in TFP contribution, with a slight negative effect, and modest contributions from other components.
- **UK**: Reduction in TFP contribution and moderate contributions from Labour Composition.
- **Germany (DU)**: Much lower TFP contributions compared to past periods, but Labour Composition becomes a significant factor.
- **France (FRA)** and **Italy/Spain (ITA/ESP)**: Considerable reduction in productivity growth driven by TFP. Labour Composition and Capital/Output show modest contributions.

### Key Insights:
- TFP (Total Factor Productivity) slowdown is a major reason for the overall labor productivity slowdown since 2007.
- Capital/Output and Labor Composition continue to contribute but do not offset the decline in TFP.
- Different regions have varying compositions of productivity growth drivers through the periods, but a general decline in TFP contribution is evident in the latest period (2007–2019).
