### Summary:

**Figure 1: NASA Spending and Patenting, 1947-1992**

The figure consists of two panels depicting NASA's budget and patenting activity from 1947 to 1992.

#### Panel A: NASA Spending
This bar graph presents NASA's annual spending (in millions of 1958 dollars):

- **Total Spending:** Represented by blue bars.
- **Contractor Spending:** Represented by orange bars.

Key Observations:
1. A significant increase in spending is visible starting around 1958, peaking in the mid-1960s. This corresponds with the Apollo program and the race to the moon.
2. After peaking around 1965-1966, spending declines until the early 1970s, followed by a more gradual increase starting in the mid-1980s.

#### Panel B: Patenting
This line graph shows the trend of patenting activity:

- **NASA Patents:** Represented by the blue line, showing patents assigned to or funded by NASA.
- **Government Patents ('00s):** Shown in orange.
- **Total Patents ('000s):** Depicted in gray.

Key Observations:
1. NASA patent activity saw a sharp increase around 1960, peaking in the early 1970s.
2. After this peak, there is a fluctuating yet generally upward trend in NASA's patents until 1992.
3. Government patents and total patents also show smaller increases, but their trends are less pronounced compared to NASA-specific patents.

#### Notes:
- The data is sourced from the United States Patent and Trademark Office and NASA Historical Data Books.
- It includes fiscal year 1963 contractor spending for both 1963 and earlier.
- NASA spending is adjusted to 1958 dollar values.

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of NASA's financial investment and output in technological innovations over the specified 45-year period.
