The image is a line graph displaying the trends in three different core inflation measures: HICP (Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices), CPI (Consumer Price Index), and PCI (Personal Consumption Expenditures) from 1999 to 2023.

### Key Observations:

1. **Historical Trends (1999-2020):**
   - All three measures exhibit fluctuations around the 2% level, which is often considered a target inflation rate.
   - There are noticeable spikes and drops in specific periods like 2008-2009 (global financial crisis) and 2015-2016, reflecting economic events during these times.

2. **Recent Trends (2020-2023):**
   - Significant spikes in all three measures are observed starting around 2021, peaking around 2022.
   - After peaking, the rates for all three measures have started to decline but remain higher than the historical average.

3. **Comparison Among Measures:**
   - Throughout the period, the CPI core (orange line) appears to be more volatile compared to the HICP core (blue line) and PCI core (grey line).
   - All three measures show a high correlation, especially during significant economic changes.

### Summary:

The graph portrays core inflation trends via HICP, CPI, and PCI from 1999 to 2023, highlighting stability around 2% for most of the period with noticeable deviations during economic crises. However, since 2021, there's been a marked increase in all measures, surging to recent highs by 2022, followed by a subsequent decline in 2023, though remaining elevated compared to historical norms. The CPI core shows higher volatility compared to HICP and PCI cores.
