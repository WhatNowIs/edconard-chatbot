The chart titled "Examples of the Yen carry trade" illustrates the performance of three financial assets indexed to January 1, 2020 (where January 1, 2020 = 0) and measured in Japanese Yen (JPY). The chart spans from the start of 2020 through mid-2024, with the data source being Bloomberg, JPMAM as of August 5, 2024.

The three assets tracked are:
1. S&P 500 in JPY (shown in yellow)
2. Mexican fixed income in JPY (shown in red)
3. Japanese fixed income in JPY (shown in blue)

Key observations:
- S&P 500 in JPY and Mexican fixed income in JPY show significant growth over the period, with similar trends and near-parallel growth patterns starting around mid-2020. Both assets saw considerable gains from 2021 onwards, peaking in mid-2024 before experiencing a sharp decline.
- Specifically, the Mexican fixed income in JPY demonstrated higher volatility compared to the S&P 500 in JPY, with more pronounced fluctuations.
- Japanese fixed income in JPY remained relatively stable around the zero index level throughout the period, indicating little to no growth in terms of carry trade benefits when converted to JPY.

In summary, the S&P 500 and Mexican fixed income, when converted to JPY, both showed substantial increases over the period with high volatility, while Japanese fixed income essentially remained flat, reflecting the differing impacts and potential returns from the Yen carry trade strategy among these assets.
