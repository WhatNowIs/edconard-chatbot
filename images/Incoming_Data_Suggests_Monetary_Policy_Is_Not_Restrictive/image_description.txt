This image presents a graph titled "Fed model estimate of r-star," from the Holston-Laubach-Williams model depicting the natural rate of interest. The x-axis spans from the year 1990 to 2023, and the y-axis measures the interest rate in percentages, ranging from 0.0% to 5.0%.

Key points:
1. **Early 1990s to Early 2001**: The natural rate of interest started at around 4.0% in 1990, experiencing a general decrease with some fluctuations, reaching slightly above 3.0% by the late 1990s and peaking again around 2000 at approximately 3.8%.
2. **Early 2000s to 2007**: The rate saw a decline from the early 2000s, dipping below 3.0% and eventually reaching below 2.0% before 2007.
3. **2008 Financial Crisis**: There is a sharp decrease during the 2008 financial crisis, plummeting the rate to below 1.0%.
4. **Post-2008 Crisis**: Following the financial crisis, the natural rate remained relatively low, fluctuating between 0.5% and 1.0% through the 2010s.
5. **2020 Pandemic**: There is another notable dip around the 2020 pandemic, but the rate briefly increased before continuing its downward trajectory.
6. **2023**: By 2023, the rate declines further, nearing around 0.5% again.

The shaded areas likely indicate periods of economic recession, correlating with the data points where significant decreases in the natural rate of interest are observed. Overall, the natural rate of interest appears to be on a long-term declining trend, with significant drops during periods of economic uncertainty such as the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic.
