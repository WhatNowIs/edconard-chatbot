The chart presents a comparison between what the Federal Reserve (the Fed) has communicated regarding future interest rates and what the market has priced in. The chart uses implied yields as the metric and covers the period from January 2023 to December 2023.

**Key points:**

- **January - March 2023:** Both the Fed and the market are in agreement up to the end of March 2023, with the implied yield reaching about 4.90% by March 22, 2023.
- **Rate hikes:** The chart shows specific planned rate hikes: 25 basis points (bps) on February 1 and March 22, 2023.
- **Mid-2023 Divergence:**
  - **Fed's View (Blue Line):** The implied yields communicated by the Fed increase to a peak of around 5.15% by May 3, 2023, and then stabilize.
  - **Market's View (Green Line):** The market also sees an increase in the implied yields until the mid-year, peaking at 4.99% but then starts to decline, reflecting a different expectation.
- **End-2023:** By December 2023, the Fed maintains an implied yield of around 5.125%, while the market projects a lower implied yield of around 4.29%.
- **Explanations:**
  - Fed Chair Powell insists on using the higher discount rate (~5.125%) as the rate for the market.
  - The market looks beyond the mid-year peak rate and uses a lower discount rate (~4.29%) to value securities.

**Summary:** 
The chart illustrates a divergence between the Federal Reserve's forecasted interest rate path and the market's expectations. While both agree on the short-term interest rate increases up to March 2023, the market starts expecting lower rates past mid-2023, in contrast to the Fed's higher rates. By the end of 2023, this gap widens significantly, with the Fed maintaining a higher rate while the market anticipates a substantial decrease.
