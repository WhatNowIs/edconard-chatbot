The image presents two graphs depicting economic data over time:

1. **Federal Funds Rate Target (2010 - year-end 2023)**:
   - This line graph shows the changes in the Federal Funds rate target.
   - From 2010 to around 2015, the rate remained close to 0%.
   - Between 2015 to 2019, there was a gradual increase, peaking just below 2.5%.
   - The rate decreased sharply in 2020, presumably in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - Starting March 2022, the Federal Reserve initiated a tightening cycle, significantly increasing the rate to reach around 5% by the end of 2023.

2. **U.S. Venture-Capital Deal Value, Yearly (2010 - 2023)**:
   - This bar graph displays the yearly venture-capital deal values in the United States.
   - There is a steady increase from 2010, where the deal value was below $50 billion, to around 2018.
   - From 2018 onward, the values continue rising sharply, peaking in 2021 at a value just under $300 billion.
   - Following this peak, 2022 and 2023 show a decline in deal values, returning to levels seen around 2020.

**Summary**:
The graphs depict significant economic trends in the United States over the last decade. The Federal Funds rate witnessed a low and stable period until around 2015, followed by a slow increase, a sharp drop in 2020, and a substantial rise starting in March 2022 up to 2023. Parallelly, U.S. venture-capital deal values have generally increased, with notable spikes leading up to a peak in 2021 and a subsequent decline in 2022 and 2023.
