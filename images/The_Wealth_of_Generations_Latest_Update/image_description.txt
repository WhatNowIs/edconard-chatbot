The image is a line graph titled "Generational Wealth per Capita," which shows inflation-adjusted wealth using Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) for three generational cohorts: Boomers, Gen X, and Millennials. The data is current through Q3 of 2022, with all other years representing the 4th quarter. The graph was created by Jeremy Horpedahl (@jmhorp).

Key points from the graph:

- The x-axis represents the median cohort age, ranging from 18 to 48 years.
- The y-axis represents generational wealth per capita, ranging from -$100,000 to $700,000.
- Boomers, represented by the orange line, show a significant increase in per capita wealth as their median age approaches 48 years, peaking at around $600,000.
- Gen X, represented by the yellow line, also shows an increasing trend in wealth with age, closely following the Boomers' trajectory but without surpassing their peak wealth.
- Millennials, represented by the green line, have a lower starting point and a more gradual increase in wealth compared to Boomers and Gen X, peaking at under $200,000 by age 38.

In summary, the graph illustrates that Boomers have accumulated the most wealth per capita compared to Gen X and Millennials, with wealth generally increasing as the median cohort age rises. Millennials have not yet reached the upper wealth levels observed in the older generations at similar ages.
