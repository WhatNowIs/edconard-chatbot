The graph titled "EXHIBIT 1: WORLD REAL GDP AND WORLD TOTAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION, 1820-2021" illustrates the correlation between global economic growth (measured by World Real GDP) and global energy consumption spanning from 1820 to 2021. Here are the key points:

1. **Axes and Units:**
   - The left axis represents World Real GDP in billion 2017 dollars (log scale).
   - The right axis represents World Energy Consumption in terawatt-hours (TWh, log scale).

2. **General Trends:**
   - Both World Real GDP and World Energy Consumption show significant long-term upward trends.
   - The two measures appear to be closely correlated over time, indicating that as the global economy expands, energy consumption also increases.

3. **Historical Context:**
   - From the early 1800s to the early 1900s, both lines gradually rise, showing steady growth in world GDP and energy consumption.
   - Post-1950s: There is a marked acceleration in both trends, coinciding with rapid industrialization and technological advancements globally.

4. **Modern Context:**
   - In recent decades, both GDP and energy consumption have continued to rise, albeit with occasional fluctuations.
   - The latest data point from 2021 shows the highest levels of both GDP and energy consumption in recorded history.

5. **Source:**
   - The data is sourced from "Our World in Data" as of 2021.

In summary, this graph highlights the significant, correlated rise in global economic output and energy consumption over the past two centuries. The rapid growth post-1950 underscores the impact of industrialization and technological progress on both metrics.
