The image is a graph titled "Figure 1. U.S. Employment to Population Ratio, Feb. 2020 â€“ Present," which displays the percent of the population aged 16 and older that is employed. Here are some key points from the graph and its annotations:

- **Feb 2020 EPOP (Employment to Population Ratio)**: The graph includes a dotted line indicating the employment to population ratio adjusted for sex and age as of February 2020 using the Fisher Index. This adjusted ratio sits around the 61% mark.
- **Actual Employment to Population Ratio**: The solid line represents the actual employment to population ratio from February 2020 to the present as of July 19, 2023.
- **Initial Decline**: From February 2020 to approximately April 2020, there is a sharp decline, dropping the ratio to below 52%. This likely corresponds to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Recovery and Fluctuation**: After this steep drop, there's a gradual recovery trend, with some fluctuation periodically, until it steadies above 60% approaching February 2023, but still slightly below the pre-pandemic adjusted level.
- **Sources**: This data is sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers.
- **Timestamp**: The data is up to date as of July 19, 2023, at 6:00 pm.

The graph effectively illustrates the significant drop in the employment to population ratio at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a recovery over the subsequent years. However, the ratio has not fully returned to the pre-pandemic adjusted level.
