The image presents data on federal energy funding in the United States over the next 5-10 years, as of October 2022. The funding is provided through two legislative frameworks: the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL).

Here is the breakdown of the funding (in billion dollars) for various energy sectors:

1. **Batteries and renewables**: Nearly $100 billion, with significant contributions from both IRA and BIL.
2. **Clean electricity**: Approximately $80-$90 billion, predominantly from IRA.
3. **Carbon**: Around $60 billion, with a balanced contribution from both IRA and BIL.
4. **Nuclear**: Approximately $40 billion, with notable funding from both IRA and BIL.
5. **Clean transport**: Just under $40 billion, majorly from IRA.
6. **Efficiency**: Close to $30 billion, mainly sourced from IRA.
7. **Hydrogen**: Around $25 billion, contributed by both IRA and BIL.
8. **Grid and resilience**: Nearly $20 billion, largely provided by BIL.
9. **Other clean energy**: Roughly $10 billion, split between IRA and BIL.
10. **Smart tech**: Slightly over $5 billion, with contributions from both IRA and BIL.
11. **Recycling**: Minimal funding.
12. **Other**: Minimal funding.

The overall distribution shows that most sectors receive substantial funding from the Inflation Reduction Act, with a significant portion also coming from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Batteries and renewables, clean electricity, and carbon capture are particularly emphasized in the funding plans.
