The image is a chart titled "Exhibit 11: Trimmed Inflation Trend Remains Rangebound, Despite the Boost from the January Effect" sourced from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.

The chart displays the trends in Trimmed Core PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) Inflation, annualized in percent, over a period from January 2019 to January 2024. Three different time horizons are shown using different markers:

- A 6-Month trend is indicated using a light blue line.

Main observations:
1. There is a noticeable rise in inflation starting from early 2021 through mid-2022, peaking at approximately 5-6% annualized.
2. Following the peak, the inflation trends display significant downward movement from mid-2022 onward.
3. As of January 2024, the data shows:
   - The 1-Month trimmed inflation rate is around 2.2%.
