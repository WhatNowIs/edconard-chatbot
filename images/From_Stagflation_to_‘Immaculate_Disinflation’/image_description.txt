The line chart displays the annualized 3-month core inflation rates from January 2021 to November 2022. Here's a summary of the data:

1. **Initial Period (Jan 2021 - May 2021)**: The core inflation rate starts relatively low and shows a steady increase from around 1-2% in January 2021 to approximately 4-5% by May 2021.

2. **Peak (Jun 2021 - Jul 2021)**: There is a significant spike in inflation, peaking at about 10% in July 2021.

3. **Decline and Stabilization (Aug 2021 - Jun 2022)**: Post the peak, the inflation rate declines sharply but then stabilizes around 4-6% for the rest of 2021 and the first half of 2022.

4. **Minor Fluctuation (Jul 2022 - Sep 2022)**: Around mid-2022, there is a minor peak reaching around 6% but then begins a gradual downward trend.

5. **Recent Period (Oct 2022 - Nov 2022)**: The core inflation rate shows a marked decline, falling to about 3% by November 2022, signaling a potential easing of inflation pressures.

Overall, the chart highlights significant fluctuations in core inflation over the observed period, with notable spikes and subsequent declines. The trend by the end of 2022 suggests a downward movement in the inflation rate.
