The provided graph, titled "3Y Trailing Monthly Stock-Bond Correlation vs. Avg. Core Inflation Rate over Same Period," illustrates the relationship between stock-bond correlation over a three-year trailing period and the average core inflation rate for the same period.

Key observations:
1. **Axes**:
   - The x-axis represents the 3-year average core inflation rate, ranging from 0% to 12%.
   - The y-axis represents the 3-year stock-bond correlation, ranging from -0.80 to 0.80.

2. **Trend Analysis**:
   - When the average core inflation rate is low (0% to 2%), the stock-bond correlation predominantly lies between -0.60 to 0.00, indicating a negative to neutral correlation.
   - As the average core inflation rate increases (approximately 2% to 5%), there is a tendency for the stock-bond correlation to be around 0.00 to 0.40, indicating a neutral to positive correlation.
   - For core inflation rates exceeding 5% up to 12%, the stock-bond correlation is mainly clustered around 0.20 to 0.60, indicating a stronger positive correlation.

3. **Clusters**:
   - There are evident clusters in the datasets corresponding to different ranges of average core inflation rates. The scatter plot shows distinct groups, especially around the 3-6% and 7-8% inflation rates, where the correlation remains largely within a specific range.

4. **Data Source**:
   - The data is sourced from Bloomberg and SBBI Ibbotson US Large Stocks and US Long-Term Government prior to 1989.

Summary:
The graph suggests that the relationship between stock and bond returns varies with the inflation environment. Generally, during periods of low inflation, stocks and bonds tend to exhibit negative to neutral correlation, whereas in moderate to high inflation periods, their correlation tends to become more positively correlated. This information may be critical for investors in understanding asset diversification benefits in different inflation scenarios.
