This image is an area chart illustrating the trends in insured losses due to various natural hazards in the U.S. from 2014 to 2022. 

Key points:
1. **Severe Storms**: The data show that severe storms have increasingly become the dominant cause of insured losses over the period, with substantial peaks around 2017 and 2020.
2. **Hurricanes**: These have also caused significant insured losses, particularly noticeable peaks in 2017 and 2022, and remain a prominent source of losses.
3. **Wildfires**: The impact of wildfires has varied, with notable spikes around 2017 and a consistent rise post-2020.
4. **Flooding**: While flooding has contributed to insured losses, its impact appears relatively smaller compared to severe storms and hurricanes.
5. **Other Hazards**: Including drought, winter weather, and earthquakes, these also contribute to insured losses but are not as dominant.

The source of this data is Aon and the image note highlights that "other" hazards include drought, winter weather, and earthquakes. The chart indicates that changing weather patterns are making wind and hail storms more frequent and severe, thus affecting the insurance landscape in the U.S. significantly over the analyzed years.
