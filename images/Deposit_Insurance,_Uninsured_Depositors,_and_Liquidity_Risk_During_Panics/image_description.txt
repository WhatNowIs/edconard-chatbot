The image presents a comparative visualization of the locations of Postal Savings Depositories and Commercial Banks across the United States in 1928. It consists of two panels:

1. **Panel A: Postal Savings Depositories**
    - This map is marked with purple dots to show the locations of all postal savings depositories in operation in 1928.
    - A higher concentration of these depositories is evident in the Eastern United States, particularly around the Great Lakes, and the Northeastern region. The Western regions, including states like Nevada and Wyoming, show fewer depositories.

2. **Panel B: Commercial Banks**
    - This map uses green dots to represent towns with at least one commercial bank in 1928.
    - Similar to the postal savings depositories, commercial banks are also densely concentrated in the Eastern U.S., around the Great Lakes, and along the East Coast. There are relatively fewer commercial banks in the Western regions of the country.

Additionally, shaded areas on the maps indicate states for which balance sheet data is unavailable.

**Summary:**
In 1928, Postal Savings Depositories and Commercial Banks were heavily concentrated in the Eastern U.S., particularly around the Great Lakes and the Northeastern region, while the Western and some Southern states had fewer institutions. The shading on the maps indicates states lacking available balance sheet data for that period.
