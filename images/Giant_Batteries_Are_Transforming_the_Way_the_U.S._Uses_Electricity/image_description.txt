The image is a comparison of how California powered itself in April 2021 and how it is projected to power itself in April 2024. It shows average daily electricity generation by fuel type over a 24-hour period.

### Key Points from April 2021:
1. **Solar Power**: Solar power plays a significant role during the daylight hours, especially between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.
2. **Other Sources**:
   - **Imports**: Substantial reliance on imported electricity.
   - **Gas**: Significant contribution throughout the day, peaking during non-solar hours.
   - **Wind**: Consistent but variable contribution.
   - **Hydro**: Steady generation throughout the day.
   - **Nuclear**: Constant base load contribution.

### Key Points from Projected April 2024:
1. **Increased Solar Power**: The contribution of solar power is projected to grow, covering more of the midday demand and extending later into the evening.
2. **Introduction of Batteries**: Batteries are expected to come online primarily in the evening hours, aiding in managing electricity supply after solar power diminishes.
3. **Other Sources**:
   - **Imports**: Still significant but potentially reduced in the midday due to increased solar power.
   - **Gas**: Continued contribution, likely balancing when solar and battery contributions wane.
   - **Wind, Hydro, Nuclear**: Expected to maintain similar contributions as observed in April 2021.

### Overall Summary:
The comparison illustrates a significant shift towards renewable energy, especially solar power, coupled with new battery storage to better manage supply. The reliance on imports is expected to reduce slightly during peak solar generation hours, indicating progress toward a more self-sustaining energy model. Traditional sources like gas, hydro, wind, and nuclear continue to play critical roles in meeting California's energy demands.
