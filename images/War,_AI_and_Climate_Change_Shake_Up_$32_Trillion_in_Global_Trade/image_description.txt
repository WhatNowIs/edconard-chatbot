This bar and scatter plot from Bloomberg Economics and the US Census Bureau illustrates the countries that gained market share in the US as China's exports to the US underperformed due to tariffs. The countries shown include Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, India, Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Mexico.

Two key metrics are presented:
1. **Over-Performance in Tariffed Categories, Value (LHS)**: This is represented by the black bars on the left-hand side (LHS) y-axis (in billion USD) and indicates the value of imports over the implied value in tariffed categories.
2. **Over-Performance in Tariffed Categories, Relative to Implied at Constant Market Shares (RHS)**: This is depicted by the blue diamonds on the right-hand side (RHS) y-axis (percentage) and shows the percentage of implied US import value.

Key Observations:
- **Vietnam** and **Mexico** show the highest value of over-performance in tariffed categories, with Vietnam slightly leading.
- **Vietnam** dominates in absolute value terms (~44 billion USD).
- **Mexico** demonstrates significant over-performance relative to implied market shares, reaching over 90%.
- **Taiwan** also shows notable performance, both in value (~30 billion USD) and relative terms.
- **Countries like India**, **Korea**, and **Thailand** demonstrate moderate gains in market share.
- **Turkey**, **Indonesia**, and **Malaysia** register smaller gains compared to the others.

The data indicates that these countries are benefiting from China's reduced exports to the US due to tariffs, with Vietnam and Mexico being the most significant beneficiaries.
