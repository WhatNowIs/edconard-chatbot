The image is a graph illustrating the trends of total deficits, primary deficits or surpluses, and net interest outlays as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from 1973 to 2023, with projections extending to 2033. 

- **Total Deficit or Surplus**: 
  The black line represents the total deficit or surplus over the years. This has been mostly negative, indicating a deficit, with fluctuations showing deeper declines around specific years such as the early 1980s, late 2000s, and a significant drop around 2020.
  
- **Primary Deficit or Surplus**:
  The dark pink (purple) bars represent the primary deficit or surplus, excluding net interest expenses. Similar to the total deficit trend, the primary balance has remained mostly negative. Notable peaks in the primary deficit occurred around the early 1980s, early 2000s, and again around 2020.

- **Net Interest Outlays**:
  The light pink bars indicate net interest outlays. These also contribute to the overall deficit, with a visible increase over time, particularly intensifying after the 1990s.

**Historical Trends**:
- From the late 1970s to early 1990s, the deficit steadily grew.
- The mid-1990s saw an improvement, reaching a surplus by late 1990s and early 2000s.
- The early 2000s saw a return to deficits, which deepened significantly during the Great Recession (late 2007-2009).
- A massive spike in the deficit is observed around 2020, likely reflecting the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Projections (Post-2023)**:
- The projections suggest that the deficits will continue but show some signs of improvement.
- Net interest outlays are expected to slightly increase, indicating growing costs of servicing debt.

Overall, the graph provides a visual representation of the United States' fiscal health over the last five decades and offers a projection into the next decade, signaling significant economic fluctuations influenced by policy decisions, economic crises, and external factors like pandemics.
