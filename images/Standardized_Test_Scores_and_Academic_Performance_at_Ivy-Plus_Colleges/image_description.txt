The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between SAT scores and cumulative first-year college GPA. Key observations include:

1. **Positive Correlation**: There is a clear positive correlation between SAT scores and first-year college GPA. As SAT scores increase, first-year GPA generally increases as well.
  
2. **Score Range**: The SAT scores in the data range from 1200 to 1600.

3. **GPA Range**: The cumulative first-year college GPA ranges from approximately 3.2 to 3.7.

4. **Trend Line**: A trend line through the data points reaffirms the positive correlation, showing a steady increase in GPA with higher SAT scores.

5. **Outliers**: A single data point represents students who did not submit SAT/ACT scores as part of their college applications. This point lies to the right of the SAT score range and has a cumulative GPA around 3.35.

6. **Higher Scores, Higher GPA**: Students with higher SAT scores (close to 1600) tend to have GPAs close to 3.6-3.7.

In summary, the scatter plot suggests that students who score higher on the SAT tend to achieve higher GPAs in their first year of college, indicating the SAT score as a potential predictor of academic success in the initial college year.
