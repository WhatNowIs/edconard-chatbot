The image is a bar chart titled "China's Coming Confucian Burden: Percentage of Middle-Aged Chinese With Living Parents, 2040 (projected, Eberstadt and Verdery)." The chart shows projections for the proportion of middle-aged Chinese individuals (ages 40-69) who will have zero, one, or two living parents in the year 2040. The data is divided into three age groups: 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69.

Key findings from the chart:

1. **Ages 40-49**:
   - Approximately 15% are projected to have zero living parents.
   - About 55% are projected to have one living parent.
   - Roughly 30% are projected to have two living parents.

2. **Ages 50-59**:
   - Around 40% are projected to have zero living parents.
   - About 50% are projected to have one living parent.
   - Approximately 10% are projected to have two living parents.

3. **Ages 60-69**:
   - Nearly 70% are projected to have zero living parents.
   - Close to 30% are projected to have one living parent.
   - A very small percentage will have two living parents.

The chart includes a note emphasizing that in 2000, only about a tenth of China's 60-somethings had any living parents, highlighting a significant demographic shift over 40 years.
