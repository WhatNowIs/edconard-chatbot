The chart illustrates the growth of U.S. battery storage capacity from 2015 to 2025, measured in gigawatts (GW). 

Key points from the chart:

1. **From 2015 to 2020**: The battery storage capacity remained relatively low and consistent, staying under 2 GW.

2. **Significant Growth Post-2020**: Starting in 2021, there was a noticeable increase in battery storage capacity. 

3. **2021 to 2022**: There was a gradual rise in capacity, reaching about 5 GW by the end of 2022.

4. **From 2023 Onwards**: Both operating and planned capacities show a significant rise. 
   - In 2023, the operating capacity saw a steep increase, reaching approximately 10 GW, with additional planned projects solely contributing to the total capacity approaching 15 GW.
   - For 2024 and 2025, the trend continues upwards, with the planned capacity further increasing, reaching totals just under 30 GW each year. The operating capacity is also set to increase, though not as dramatically.

5. **Planned vs. Operating Capacity**: Planned capacity (indicated in light blue) shows significant contributions to the total capacity increase in future years, indicating a robust pipeline of upcoming projects.

Overall, the U.S. energy sector shows a strong commitment to expanding battery storage capacity, with more significant developments and projects expected to come online through 2025.
