This image shows two charts related to prime age women, focusing on their educational attainment and motherhood status:

**(a) Employment rates**
The first chart (a) illustrates employment rates for different groups of prime age women over the period from 1995 to 2020:
- Women with a college degree and children under age 10 (orange solid line) show an increasing trend in employment rates, reaching about 80% in 2020.
- Women with a college degree and no children under age 10 (yellow dashed line) have consistently higher employment rates, hovering around 80-85% across the years.
- Women without a college degree but with children under age 10 (light blue dashed line) exhibit declining employment rates since the early 2000s, dipping below 60% at times.
- Women without a college degree and no children under age 10 (dark blue solid line) show fluctuating employment rates, but generally lower than those with a college degree. Their rates saw a significant drop around the 2008 financial crisis but have been rising since then, reaching around 65% in 2020.

**(b) Population shares**
The second chart (b) conveys the population shares of these groups from 1995 to 2020:
- Women without a college degree and no children under age 10 (blue section) constitute the largest group in all years, but their share has been decreasing from about 50% in the early 1990s to below 40% by 2020.
- Women with a college degree and no children under age 10 (yellow section) have a growing share of the population, increasing from about 25% to around 35% over the same period.
- Women without a college degree but with children under age 10 (dark blue section) also exhibit a shrinking population share, decreasing from around 20% to just over 10%.
- Women with a college degree and children under age 10 (orange section) have a relatively stable population share of about 10-12%, with slight increases over time.

In summary, employment rates differ significantly based on educational attainment and motherhood status among prime age women. Women with college degrees generally have higher employment rates, and there is a noticeable trend of an increasing share of women with college degrees in the population.
