The image consists of two graphs that provide insights from Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research on the potential impact of AI on labor productivity growth and the associated investment cycle required for AI transition.

**Key Points:**

1. **Estimated Effect of Widespread AI Adoption on Annual Productivity Growth:**
   - Emerging Markets (EM): AI adoption could increase annual productivity growth by 1.0 percentage points.
   - Developed Markets (DM): AI adoption is estimated to boost productivity growth by 1.5 percentage points.
   - Global: Overall, AI adoption could contribute to a 1.3 percentage points increase in annual productivity growth.
   
   The estimates are derived from composites based on market FX GDP country weights and reflect stylized scenarios where productivity gains are realized over a 10-year period post widespread AI adoption.

2. **Stylized US AI Investment Cycle:**
   - To transition successfully to widespread AI adoption, significant investment is required, categorized into:
     - Hardware: User Queries (grey area)
     - Hardware: Model Training (light blue area)
     - Software (dark blue area)
   - The investment trend suggests an initial increase starting around 2024, peaking between 2030-2035, and gradually stabilizing from 2035 to 2040.
   - Investment as a percentage of GDP could peak at approximately 2.5% to 3.0% around 2030.

In summary, the research indicates that AI could significantly drive labor productivity growth both globally and regionally. However, this potential will necessitate a substantial and phased investment cycle over the next two decades, particularly in hardware and software infrastructure.
