The chart from Economic Innovation Group presents the retention rates of international students in the U.S. who graduated between 2012 and 2020, based on their degree levels, as of 2021. The findings are as follows:

- Only 17% of Bachelor's degree recipients remained in the U.S. after graduating.
- 41% of all students across Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD degrees stayed in the U.S.
- 51% of Master's degree recipients chose to stay.
- The highest retention rate was among PhD recipients, with 76% remaining in the U.S.

This data indicates that retention rates of international students are significantly higher for those with advanced degrees, particularly PhDs.
