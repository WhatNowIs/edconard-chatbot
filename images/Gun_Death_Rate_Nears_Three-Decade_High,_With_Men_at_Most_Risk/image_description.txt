The image provides an analysis of rising firearm fatality rates in the U.S. from 1990 to 2020, broken down by suicide and homicide rates, as well as by race and gender. It derives its data from sources such as JAMA Network Open and CDC WISQARS.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Overall Firearm Fatality Rates:** 
   - Since 2014, there has been an increase in overall firearm fatality rates. Both suicide and homicide rates contribute to this upward trend.

2. **Suicide Rates:** 
   - Suicide rates with firearms are particularly high among white men. 
   - The graph depicting firearm suicide rates from 1990 to 2020 shows an upward trend for white men, a stable trend for Hispanic men, and a marginal increase for Black men.

3. **Homicide Rates:** 
   - Firearm homicide rates for Black men have spiked sharply, especially noticeable in the period from the mid-2010s to 2020.
   - Homicide rates show significant racial disparities, with Black men experiencing the highest rates, much higher than those for white or Hispanic men.

4. **Trends by Race and Gender:**
   - The firearm homicide rate for Black men was highest in the early 1990s, then declined until the early 2010s before rising again.
   - White men and Hispanic men exhibit relatively lower and more stable homicide rates across the same period.

**Summary:**
The data suggest a concerning increase in firearm fatalities in the U.S., particularly since 2014. Firearm suicide rates are notably high among white men, while firearm homicide rates have risen sharply among Black men. These trends highlight significant racial and gender disparities in firearm-related deaths, calling attention to the public health and societal challenges posed by gun violence.
