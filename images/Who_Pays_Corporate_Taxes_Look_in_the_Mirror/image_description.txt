The cartoon portrays a critique of corporate tax practices. On the left side, a corpulent pig in a human-like suit with a top hat, labeled “CORPORATE TAX,” is seen hoarding a pile of cash behind a green curtain. The pig figure symbolizes wealthy corporations or corporate executives who are benefiting financially. 

To the right, a group of ordinary people is reflected in a mirror. The individuals are standing in line to deposit their money into a box labeled “ACME CORPORATION,” which then funnels this money into a bowl marked “TAXES DUE!” This suggests that regular citizens are bearing the brunt of tax responsibilities, indirectly through the corporations they patronize, while the corporations themselves avoid or minimize their own tax liabilities.

The artist uses the donkey on the left, who is painting a deceptive backdrop, to depict the inconspicuous or deceptive nature of this situation. The overall message criticizes how corporate tax practices can unburden wealthy corporations at the expense of the general public.
