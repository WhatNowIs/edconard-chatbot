The image displays Exhibit 6, which shows the monthly index of customers making childcare payments from January 2020 to December 2022, with January 2020 set as the baseline (index = 100). According to Bank of America internal data, the number of customers making childcare payments as of December 2022 was 7% lower than at the beginning of 2020.

Key observations from the graph:

1. **January 2020 (Baseline)**: The index starts at 100.
2. **Early 2020 Decline**: There is a sharp drop in the index to around 30 by mid-2020, likely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related shutdowns.
3. **Gradual Recovery**: From mid-2020 onwards, the number of customers making childcare payments gradually increases but remains below the January 2020 level.
4. **Volatility**: The index shows occasional fluctuations but generally trends upwards, stabilizing around 90 by late 2022.
5. **December 2022**: The index is approximately 93, indicating a 7% decrease compared to January 2020.

In summary, the number of customers making childcare payments dropped dramatically in early 2020 due to the pandemic, but it has been recovering steadily, although it still remains slightly below pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2022.
