The chart titled "Visualizing Canada’s ‘demographic heat dome’... as national population surges by 1.273 million in past year" illustrates the components of Canada's population growth from 2010 to 2024, presented as a 4-quarter moving sum up to April 1, 2024. The data sources are NBF and StatCan.

The chart breaks down the population growth into three components:

1. **Natural Increase** (grey bars) – This represents the population growth due to the difference between births and deaths.
2. **Net Migration excluding Non-Permanent Residents (NPR)** (dark blue bars) – This captures the net migration figures excluding non-permanent residents.
3. **Non-Permanent Residents (NPR)** (red bars) – This component is the population growth from non-permanent residents such as temporary workers, students, and other temporary residents.

Key Observations:
- The total population growth increased significantly in the past year, reaching a surge of 1.273 million.
- Before this sharp increase, the components of population growth were relatively stable from 2010 to 2015, and then fluctuated until around 2020.
- A notable dip in 2021 is evident, likely due to the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on migration.
- Post-2021, the population growth rapidly increased, particularly from 2022 to 2024, driven largely by both net migration and non-permanent residents.
- The grey component (natural increase) remains relatively stable throughout these years, contributing less significantly compared to migration metrics (both permanent and non-permanent).

In summary, Canada's population growth has experienced a significant surge in the past year, largely driven by an increase in net migration and non-permanent residents, following a period of relative stability and a notable dip in 2021.
