The provided chart, titled "Exhibit 1: Nominal Bank Lending Growth Slowed From 10% to 2% Annualized Since the Start of the Year," illustrates the changes in bank lending rates from January 2023 to September 2023. The key points are as follows:

- At the beginning of 2023, the annualized growth rate of bank lending was approximately 10%.
- A significant decline is observed over the months, with growth dropping steadily.
- By mid-2023 (around June), the annualized growth rate fell to near 2%.
- Post-June, the fluctuations continue with minor recoveries but predominantly downward trends, reaching lows close to 0% in August.
- A slight increase is noticed in early September, but it doesn't sustain.

Annotations indicate that the data encompasses real estate, commercial and industrial (C&I), and consumer loans. An adjustment for a $60 billion transfer in March affects the reported growth rate, and occasional jumps are attributed to mergers and acquisitions.

This data, sourced from the Federal Reserve and Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, highlights a notable trend: a rapid deceleration in bank lending growth throughout 2023, which could indicate tighter lending conditions or weakened demand for loans.
