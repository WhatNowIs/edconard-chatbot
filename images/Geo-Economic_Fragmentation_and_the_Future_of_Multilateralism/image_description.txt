The image presents a chart titled "Figure 2: Global Flows of Goods, Services and Finance ($ trillion, unless indicated otherwise)" depicting the trends in global exports from 1980 to 2020. It includes separate bars for goods, services, and finance flows, along with a line graph representing the flows as a percentage of GDP (Gross Domestic Product).

Key points highlighted in the chart include:

1. **Goods Exports**: Represented by the green bars, goods exports have shown an overall steady increase from 1980 to 2020. Remarkable growth occurred from the early 2000s to 2008 before experiencing a decline around the 2008 financial crisis. From 2010 onwards, goods exports resumed growth, reaching a peak around 2020.

2. **Services Exports**: Illustrated by the red bars, services exports have grown consistently over the period, although at a slower pace compared to goods. The growth is especially noticeable from the early 2000s onward.

3. **Finance Flow Exports**: Depicted by the yellow bars, finance flows increased substantially starting in the mid-1990s, peaking around the 2008 financial crisis, then showing fluctuations but maintaining a general upward trend since.

4. **Flows as Percent of GDP**: The blue line represents the total global flows of goods, services, and finance as a percentage of global GDP. This metric shows peaks around the mid-1990s and 2008, indicating significant increases in exports relative to global GDP at these times, followed by noticeable declines after the 2008 financial crisis. The percentages have again shown an upward trajectory post-2010.

**Sources**: The data is sourced from the IMF Balance of Payments, World Bank, and IMF staff calculations. A note clarifies that the figure shows exports only.

**Summary**: The chart provides a clear visualization of growth trends in the global export of goods, services, and financial flows over four decades. It captures the impact of economic events, such as the 2008 financial crisis, on these flows, demonstrating the dynamic nature of global trade and financial interactions relative to GDP.
