The provided image consists of two key graphs and relevant annotations that provide insights into labor force metrics from January 2019 to December 2022. Here's a summary of the information presented:

**Title:**
- Labor Force Participation and Average Weekly Hours, Seasonally Adjusted, January 2019 to December 2022 (Participation) and November 2022 (Hours)

**Graphs:**
1. **A: Labor Force Participation**
   - This graph tracks the labor force participation rate over time. It shows a relatively stable participation rate around 63% until early 2020, after which there is a sharp decline to about 60% due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, there is a gradual recovery followed by minor fluctuations, stabilizing around 62% by the end of 2022.

2. **B: Average Weekly Hours**
   - This graph illustrates the average weekly hours worked (3-month centered moving average). The trend shows a peak around 37.7 hours early in the period, with a notable drop during early 2020 to about 35 hours coinciding with the pandemic. After that, there is a partial recovery, with continued fluctuations and a final average settling around 36 hours towards the end of 2022.

**Source:**
- Bureau of Labor Statistics and authors' calculations.

**Notes:**
- The data is seasonally adjusted. Labor force participation is as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), and hours data is sourced from the IPUMS database.
- Seasonally adjusted using X-12 seasonal adjustment command in Eviews.
- Multiplicative X-11 method and auto X-12 seasonal and trend filter applied.
- Averaged over 3 months.

**Summary:**
The image offers a comparative analysis of labor force participation rates and average weekly hours over four years. Both metrics are significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with noticeable drops in early 2020 followed by partial recoveries. Labor force participation rates show stabilization around pre-pandemic levels, while average weekly hours indicate continued variability, slightly below pre-pandemic peaks. The seasonally adjusted data helps in understanding the underlying trends by smoothing out seasonal fluctuations.
