The graph titled "Real average hourly earnings, change from a year earlier" presents data on the year-over-year percentage change in real average hourly earnings from 2017 to 2022. Key points from the graph include:

1. **Stable Earnings (2017-2019):** From 2017 through the end of 2019, real average hourly earnings generally remained around 0% to 2%, indicating relatively stable earnings growth with minor fluctuations.

2. **Earnings Spike (Early 2020):** In early 2020, there is a significant spike where earnings increased sharply, peaking at around 7% year-over-year. This suggests a substantial temporary increase in earnings during this period.

3. **Sharp Decline (Mid to Late 2020):** Following the spike, there is a dramatic decline in earnings growth, plunging to -3% year-over-year by mid to late 2020. This indicates a rapid reversal, leading to decreasing real earnings.

4. **Post-2020 Variability:** After the sharp decline, the graph shows continued variability with earnings growth remaining in the negative territory but showing signs of recovery by 2022, rising towards but still below 0%.

5. **Economic Impact Factors:** The significant fluctuations starting in early 2020 are likely due to the economic impacts and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting labor markets and wages.

Overall, the graph illustrates a period of relative stability in real average hourly earnings followed by extreme volatility starting in 2020, with a notable spike and subsequent decline, and partial recovery towards the end of the period.
