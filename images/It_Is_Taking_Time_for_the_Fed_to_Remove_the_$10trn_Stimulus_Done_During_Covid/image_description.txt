The image presents a line graph tracking the consensus real GDP forecasts from various months (from September 2022 to May 2023), spanning from September 2022 to December 2024. The graph shows the quarter-over-quarter seasonally adjusted annual rate (QoQ SAAR) of GDP growth.

Key Observations:

1. **Forecasting Trends**: Each line represents GDP forecast data from a different month, indicated by color codes. These include:
   - Sep 2022 (green)
   - Oct 2022 (light blue)
   - Nov 2022 (dark blue)
   - Dec 2022 (gold)
   - Jan 2023 (gray)
   - Feb 2023 (light brown)
   - Mar 2023 (dark green)
   - Apr 2023 (dark gray)
   - May 2023 (red)

2. **Consensus Delay**: The chart shows that since October 2022, there has been a consistent trend of delays in predicting when a recession might occur. This is highlighted in the graph by a dashed line indicating "Consensus keeps delaying the recession."

3. **GDP Decline and Recovery**: Forecasts initially predict a decline in GDP growth, indicated by values dropping below zero (negative growth) around March 2023 to September 2023. Following this downturn, predictions across different forecasting periods anticipate a recovery, with GDP growth rates increasing again through late 2023 and into 2024.

4. **Recession Postponement**: The overall trend underscores that the expected period of recession has been repeatedly postponed according to these forecasts, suggesting an evolving economic outlook over this period.
