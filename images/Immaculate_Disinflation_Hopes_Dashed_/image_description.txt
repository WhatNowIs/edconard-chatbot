The image displays a chart titled "Mind the Gap." It illustrates the yearly changes in nominal wages and prices, specifically comparing wages and salaries per full-time equivalent employee (in blue) against the PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) price index (in red) from 1930 to 2020.

Key Points:
- Worker pay can fluctuate by more or less than consumer prices, usually differing by no more than 1-2 percentage points.
- Major exceptions to this trend occurred during WWII (rationing), the late 1990s (due to a productivity boom and commodity bust), and the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- The chart indicates various periods of significant divergence and convergence between wage growth and price changes.
- During 1930s and 1940s, particularly around WWII, there were substantial spikes and fluctuations.
- Post-World War II era seems relatively stable with some notable peaks in the mid-70s and early 80s.
- Economic events, such as the productivity boom in the late 1990s and the pandemic in 2020, show significant deviations in the trends.
