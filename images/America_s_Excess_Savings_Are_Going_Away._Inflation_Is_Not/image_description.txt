The image presents a graph and accompanying text summarizing trends in inflation, specifically focusing on the changes in the services PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) price index excluding energy and housing. Hereâ€™s a summarized analysis:

1. **Inflation Focus:**
   - Federal Reserve officials have shifted their focus to an inflation measure that tracks underlying inflation, particularly excluding volatile sectors like energy and housing.

2. **Historical Trends:**
   - Prior to the pandemic, inflation was steady at around 2% annually.
   - Since early 2021, this measure has accelerated to approximately 4-5% per year.

3. **Graph Details:**
   - The graph spans from 2011 to 2023.
   - It includes three lines representing different annualized measures:
     - **Y/Y (Year-over-Year)**: Solid blue line.
     - **3m/3m annualized (3-month/3-month annualized)**: Red dotted line.
     - **M/M annualized, 3mma (Month-over-Month annualized, 3-month moving average)**: Gray dotted line.
   - The graph illustrates a consistent rise from about 2% to 4-5% in the post-pandemic period, showing the sustained inflationary trend.

4. **Consistency with Wage Growth:**
   - The current inflation rate is in line with underlying wage growth, indicating broader economic shifts.

5. **Sources:**
   - The data is derived from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and calculations by Matthew Klein.

In summary, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation has risen from 2% pre-pandemic to 4-5% since early 2021, reflecting sustained inflationary pressure consistent with wage growth trends.
