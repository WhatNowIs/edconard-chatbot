### Key Insights:

1. **Wage Doubling Timeframe**:
   - For workers earning less than $40k, 26% believe their wage will double in less than 7 months, 20% within 7 months to a year, and 51% believe it will take more than a year.
   - For the full sample, 21% believe it will take less than 7 months, 29% between 7 months and a year, and 51% more than a year.
   - For workers earning more than $125k, 19% believe it will take less than 7 months, 32% 7 months to a year, and 49% more than a year.

2. **Work Impacts of Inflation**:
   - A high share of all segments are very concerned about future employment and earnings (Lowest income: 32%, Full sample: 38%, Highest income: 45%).
   - 42% of the full sample believe their income would be higher if inflation had been lower, but this sentiment is more common among higher earners (Highest income: 39%) than lower earners (Lowest income: 38%).
   - Job satisfaction will be lower if wages increase but price increases match the wage increase, with an evenly distributed sentiment (Highest income: 33%, Full sample: 35%, Lowest income: 28%).

3. **Rate of Wage Increases**:
   - A significant majority of all income groups believe prices are increasing faster than wages (Lowest income: 83%, Full sample: 81%, Highest income: 77%).
   - Wages of higher income people are perceived to be rising faster by a notable portion (55% in all groups).
   - Perception that wages of other people are rising faster is resonantly low across all groups (33%-34%).

### Summary:
The survey results reflect substantial concerns among workers about future employment and earnings due to inflation. All income groups generally believe that prices are rising faster than wages and express concerns over the pace of their wage increases relative to others. A significant portion also expresses that their job satisfaction would diminish if their wage increases are matched by equivalent price increases. The majority sentiment indicates that it would take more than a year for wages to double if inflation were to double.
