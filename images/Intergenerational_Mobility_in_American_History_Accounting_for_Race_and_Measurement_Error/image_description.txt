The figure displays updated estimates of intergenerational mobility, specifically focusing on the correlation between the status of fathers and sons across different birth cohorts from 1840 to 1980. The y-axis represents the father-son association of status, with values ranging from 0 to 1, and the x-axis categorizes the birth cohorts.

Two sets of estimates are presented:
1. **Standard Estimates (represented by red diamonds)**
2. **Updated Estimates (represented by blue triangles)**

**Key Observations:**
1. For earlier birth cohorts (from 1840 to around 1910), the standard and updated estimates show a notable disparity, with the standard estimates being significantly lower (ranging from 0.21 to 0.33) compared to the updated estimates (ranging from 0.61 to 0.83).
2. The updated estimates show a peak in the father-son association of status around the mid-1800s (0.83 for 1840) and then a slight decline and stabilization around the turn of the century (around 0.68 to 0.62).
3. From 1910 onwards, the standard estimates see minimal decline or stabilization (around 0.31), while the updated estimates show brief decreases followed by a rise, peaking at 0.70 for the 1920 cohort.
4. For later cohorts (post-1940), both estimates converge closer but still show discrepancies, with standard estimates ranging from 0.31 to 0.37, and updated ones ranging from 0.33 to 0.44.
  
**Notes:**
- These estimates represent the slope coefficient of the son's status on the fatherâ€™s status.
- The updated estimates incorporate several methodological improvements:
  1. Pooling of Black families with white families.
  2. Correction for measurement errors using instrumental variables.
  3. Adjustments for within-occupational differences in status by race and region.

Overall, the figure suggests that updated methods result in consistently higher estimates for father-son status associations, indicating lower intergenerational mobility than previously estimated by standard methods.
