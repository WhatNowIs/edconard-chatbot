The chart titled "10-year bond auction tails" shows the auction tails for 10-year Treasury bonds from January 2020 to July 2024. The term "auction tail" refers to the difference between the highest bid price and the lowest accepted bid price at a Treasury auction. 

Key points:
- The time frame covered is from January 2020 to July 2024.
- The vertical axis represents the auction tail value, ranging from -4 to 4.
- Data points show fluctuation in auction tails over time.
- A notable event marked on the chart is "Fed starts hiking" in March 2022, which refers to the Federal Reserve starting to increase interest rates.
- Before the Fed started hiking rates (pre-March 2022), the auction tails fluctuated around zero with some periods of negative and positive values.
- Post the rate hikes (post-March 2022), there is a noticeable increase in the variability and the magnitude of the auction tails, with many more instances of higher positive values, indicating greater differences in bid prices at auctions.

The summary indicates that the Fed's decision to start increasing interest rates in March 2022 had a significant impact on the auction tails of 10-year Treasury bonds, leading to greater volatility in the differences between bid prices at auctions.
