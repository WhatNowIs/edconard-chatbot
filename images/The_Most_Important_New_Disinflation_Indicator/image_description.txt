The graph titled "Inflation is Now Mostly Driven by Rent" demonstrates the contributions to annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation from 2019 to 2023. The contributions are divided into two categories: "Rent of Shelter" (shown in yellow) and "Everything Else" (shown in teal).

Key observations:
1. From 2019 to early 2021, the contributions from "Rent of Shelter" and "Everything Else" were relatively balanced, with "Everything Else" slightly higher.
2. There was a notable dip in contributions from both categories around the middle of 2020.
3. In mid-2021, inflation rates began to rise significantly, driven more by "Everything Else."
4. Starting in early 2022, "Rent of Shelter" began contributing more noticeably to overall inflation.
5. By mid-2022 and into 2023, "Rent of Shelter" emerged as a significant driver of annual CPI inflation, while contributions from "Everything Else" began to decline but still remained substantial.

Summary:
The graph illustrates that while various factors contributed to inflation from 2019 to mid-2021, the recent inflation trends in 2022 and 2023 are increasingly driven by "Rent of Shelter." The contributions from "Everything Else" other than rent peaked by mid-2022 and have since decreased, albeit still playing a significant role in overall inflation. This shift emphasizes the growing impact of rent on the cost of living.
