The image illustrates Figure 3, which shows the "Aggregate Effects of the Demand Reallocation Shock" on year-over-year (yoy) inflation. The graph delineates the inflationary impact over a span of 20 quarters, with three distinct lines representing different categories:

1. **Aggregate Inflation (Black Line)**: Shows overall inflation trends.
2. **Goods Inflation (Blue Line)**: Represents inflation specific to goods.
3. **Services Inflation (Red Line)**: Indicates inflation specific to services.

Key observations:

- In the initial quarters, goods inflation (blue) spikes significantly, reaching its peak around 5-6 percentage points.
- Services inflation (red) rises more gradually compared to goods inflation but remains relatively steady after peaking.
- There is a clear, immediate impact on aggregate inflation (black line) at the onset, primarily driven by the rapid rise in goods inflation.
- Over time, both goods and services inflation converge towards zero, indicating the diminishing effects of the demand reallocation shock as quarters progress past the 10-quarter mark.
- The pattern indicates an initial volatility in inflation due to demand shifts, which stabilizes in the long run.

This graph offers a clear visual representation of how demand reallocation impacts inflation differently across the goods and services sectors over time.
