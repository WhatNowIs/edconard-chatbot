The image consists of two charts focused on global sea-surface temperatures.

1. **Sea-Surface Temperature Chart (Left)**
   - This line graph displays the global average sea-surface temperatures in degrees Celsius from January to December, over multiple years.
   - The historical range (1991-2022) is shown in gray.
   - The years 2023 and 2024 are highlighted separately in red.
   - Both 2023 and 2024 have significantly higher temperatures compared to the historical range, indicating an increasing trend in sea-surface temperatures.

2. **Temperature Anomalies Chart (Right)**
   - This bar chart shows monthly sea-surface temperature anomalies, measured in degrees Celsius, compared to the 1991-2020 average.
   - The anomalies are displayed from 1991 to the present.
   - Negative anomalies (cooler than average) are marked in blue, while positive anomalies (warmer than average) are in red.
   - There has been a notable shift towards positive anomalies starting around the year 2000, with a significant spike in recent years, reaching up to 0.6Â°C warmer than the average.

**Summary:**
Global sea-surface temperatures are rising significantly, with recent years (2023 and 2024) displaying much higher temperatures compared to the historical average from 1991-2022. A corresponding increase in positive sea-surface temperature anomalies has been observed, particularly since the early 2000s, indicating an alarming trend towards warmer oceans.
