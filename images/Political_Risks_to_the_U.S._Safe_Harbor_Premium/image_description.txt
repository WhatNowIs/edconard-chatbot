This graph, labeled as Figure 11, illustrates the US Political/Institutional Risk Spread relative to the year 2016, with 2016 used as the baseline year (2016 = 0). The risk spread is expressed in percentage points, serving as a measure of country risk premium-equivalent, where higher values signify greater risk.

Two comparisons are depicted:
1. Against Canada (denoted by a blue line)
2. Against All Low-Risk countries (denoted by an orange line) - specifically Canada, Australia, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, and Switzerland.

The timeline spans from 2010 to 2025, highlighting several key trends:
- From 2010 to 2016, there is a general decline in risk spread for both comparisons.
- A sharp increase in the risk spread is observed starting around 2017.
- From 2017 onwards, both lines show an upward trend, indicating increasing US political/institutional risk compared to the baseline year of 2016.
- The risk spread against Canada shows a slightly higher increase compared to all low-risk countries starting from 2019 and continuing into the projected future up to 2025.

The sources of the data include V-Dem, PRS Group, World Bank, IMF, Damodoran (2023), and The Budget Lab analysis. The spread against low-risk countries is also GDP-weighted as noted in the footnote.
