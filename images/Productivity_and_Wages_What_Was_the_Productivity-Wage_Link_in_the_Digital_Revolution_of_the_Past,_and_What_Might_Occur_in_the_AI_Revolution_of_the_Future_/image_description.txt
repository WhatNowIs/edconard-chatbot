The image contains a bar graph titled "Changes in Productivity and Wages 1989-2017," which is Figure 9 from a source examining productivity and wage changes for two education groups (HS or less, College).

The graph compares changes for two groups: Low education (HS or less) and High education (College).

1. **Change in Log of Productivity (Real) 1989-2017**:
   - Individuals with Low education in 1989 experienced a smaller increase in productivity.
   - Individuals with High education in 1989 experienced a notably larger increase in productivity.

2. **Change in Log of Wages (Real) 1989-2017**:
   - Individuals with Low education in 1989 saw a moderate increase in wages.
   - Individuals with High education in 1989 also experienced an increase in wages, similar to that of their productivity change but slightly less than their productivity gain.

Overall, the data suggests that those with higher education saw greater gains in both productivity and wages over the time period from 1989 to 2017.
