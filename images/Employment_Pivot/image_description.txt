The chart illustrates the relationship between Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) job growth and Average Hourly Earnings (AHE) from January 2022 to January 2024. Key insights from the graph include:

1. **NFP (Non-Farm Payroll Job Growth)**:
   - The job growth experienced sharp fluctuations throughout the period. 
   - Notable peaks occurred in January 2022 and January 2023 with significant job gains.
   - There were periods of lower job growth, particularly in mid-2022 and early 2023.
   - By January 2024, job growth shows an upward trend.

2. **AHE (Average Hourly Earnings)**:
   - The wage growth line displays a generally downward trend.
   - Despite fluctuations, the average hourly earnings were higher in early 2022 and saw a gradual decline, stabilizing somewhat in the latter half of the period.
   
3. **Overall Trends**:
   - While job growth (NFP) demonstrated variability with certain peaks, wage growth (AHE) generally showed a moderation.
   - The summary beneath the graph emphasizes that wage growth decelerated even as job growth accelerated.
