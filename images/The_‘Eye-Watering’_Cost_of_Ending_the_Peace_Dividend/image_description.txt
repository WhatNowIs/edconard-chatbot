The chart depicts the defense expenditure of four Western countries (the US, the UK, France, and Germany) as a percentage of their GDP from 1960 to 2020. The chart indicates a general trend of decreasing defense spending across these countries since the end of the Cold War, particularly marked after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the breakup of the Soviet Union around 1990.

Key highlights:
1. The US has consistently spent a higher percentage of its GDP on defense compared to the UK, France, and Germany, although its expenditure has significantly declined from the early 1960s peak to around 4% in recent years.
2. The UK and France show similar trends, with notable declines over the same period, settling between 2% and 3% in recent years.
3. Germany's defense expenditure as a percentage of GDP has been notably lower compared to the other three countries, maintaining around 1% to 2% after reunification in the early 1990s.
4. Post-Cold War, there is a general stabilization of defense spending as a percentage of GDP across all four countries, with only moderate fluctuations. 

Overall, the chart illustrates a significant reduction in defense expenditure percentages for these Western countries since the Cold War era, continuing into the 21st century.
