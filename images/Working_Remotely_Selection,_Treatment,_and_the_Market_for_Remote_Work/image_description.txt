The image is a line graph titled "Figure 1: Difference-in-Differences Around Covid-19 Office Closures," specifically focusing on "Panel (a): Raw Averages of Calls per Hour." 

Key points of the graph include:
- It shows data points for calls per hour from December 2019 to August 2020.
- There are two lines representing two distinct job settings:
  - On-site (solid blue line)
  - Remote (dashed orange line)
- An event, indicated by a shaded area around April 2020, likely marks the significant shift or the implementation of Covid-19 office closures.
- Before April 2020, both on-site and remote jobs show an average of about 3 to 4 calls per hour.
- Around April 2020, the on-site calls slightly increased and then stabilized, while remote calls show a visible but smaller increase, followed by a convergence pattern after some fluctuations.
- Post-April 2020, both lines tend to stabilize, with remote work maintaining a slightly higher call frequency compared to pre-closure times, yet slightly lower compared to on-site calls.

Summary:
The graph examines the impact of Covid-19 office closures (around April 2020) on the average number of calls per hour for on-site and remote jobs. Prior to the office closures, both job types had similar call frequencies. Post-closure, a minor increase in call frequency is observed for both groups, with on-site jobs stabilizing at a slightly higher rate compared to remote jobs, highlighting a slight performance variation triggered by the shift to remote working conditions.
