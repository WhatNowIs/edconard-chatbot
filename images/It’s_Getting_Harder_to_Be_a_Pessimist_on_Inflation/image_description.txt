The image presents a visualization of the distribution of price increases over time, based on data from the Cleveland Federal Reserve's Median/Trimmed-Mean CPI price basket. This analysis is presented as a series of density ridgeline plots for each quarter from June 2018 to December 2022, showing 3-month annualized changes. Notably, the data has been adjusted to exclude components whose expenditure weights fall above the 85th percentile and below the 15th percentile of price changes.

The key points from the image are as follows:

1. **June 2018 to December 2019**: Price increase distributions are mainly clustered between 0% and 5%. The plots show relatively smooth and narrow distributions, indicating more stable price movements during this period.

2. **March 2020 to December 2020**: There is a noticeable shift and widening in the distribution of price changes, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Distributions become more spread out, potentially indicating higher volatility in prices.

3. **March 2021 to September 2022**: The distributions widen further and include more extreme values, with ranges from near 0% to above 10%. The colors also transition to warmer hues (green to red), suggesting higher rates of price increases and a broadening impact on different components within the CPI basket.

4. **December 2022**: The distribution seems to narrow again, indicating a reduction in the extent of price increases and signaling a possible return to more stable inflation rates similar to pre-pandemic levels.

Overall, the image illustrates how price inflation, as measured by the Median/Trimmed-Mean CPI, expanded during the pandemic and appears to be refocusing towards lower, more stable rates as of late 2022.
