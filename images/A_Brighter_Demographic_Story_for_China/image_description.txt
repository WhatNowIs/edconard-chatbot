The image displays two graphs, each representing different aspects of educational data over time:

1. **College Grads ('000)**:
    - This bar chart shows the number of college graduates (in thousands) from the year 2000 to 2023.
    - There is a clear upward trend in the number of graduates over this period.
    - In 2000, the number of graduates was around 1,000, while by 2023, it had risen to approximately 11,000.

2. **% Age Cohort**:
    - The line graph represents the percentage of a certain age cohort (likely those eligible for college graduation) over the same time period, from 2000 to 2023.
    - The percentage starts below 10% in 2000 and shows an upward trend overall, with notable increases around 2005 and subsequent steady growth.
    - There is a significant spike in percentage from 2020 onward, reaching close to 70% by 2023.

**Summary**:
Over the period from 2000 to 2023, the number of college graduates has increased dramatically from around 1,000 to approximately 11,000. Similarly, the percentage of a particular age cohort participating in college education has shown a steady increase, with a significant spike observed from 2020 onward, reaching nearly 70% by 2023. This suggests a substantial growth in higher education attainment over the past two decades, with especially rapid increases in recent years.
