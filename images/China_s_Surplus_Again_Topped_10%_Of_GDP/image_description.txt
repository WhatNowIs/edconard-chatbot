This image is a line graph titled "Chinese trade in manufactures as a share of China's GDP." It illustrates the percentage trends of two economic indicators from Q4 1996 to Q4 2022:

1. **Non-processing manufactured imports** (represented by a light red/pink line).
2. **Manufactured exports net of processing** (represented by a dark red line).

### Key Observations:
- **Non-processing manufactured imports**:
  - They started at approximately 4-5% of GDP in Q4 1996.
  - Their peak is seen around Q4 2003, reaching about 7%.
  - Following the peak, the percentage gradually declined, falling below 4% around 2014 and remaining relatively stable at a lower level subsequently.

- **Manufactured exports net of processing**:
  - Initially, they were around 8% of GDP in Q4 1996.
  - There was a steady and notable increase, peaking significantly above 18% around Q4 2007.
  - Post-peak, there was a decline that leveled out around 12% by 2012, followed by several fluctuations but an overall decline to below 10% around 2018.
  - An uptick is visible towards the end of the period, ending above 12% by Q4 2022.

### Summary:
The graph indicates that China's manufactured exports as a share of GDP grew substantially from the late 1990s to around 2007, after which they declined but remained a significant part of the GDP. In contrast, non-processing manufactured imports have remained relatively less significant, with a peak in the early 2000s but a general downward trend since then. This suggests that China has increasingly focused on exporting manufactured goods, even though the rate has somewhat stabilized in recent years with a slight rebound.
