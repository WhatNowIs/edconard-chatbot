The image is a bar chart showing the annual cumulative installed battery capacity in gigawatts in the U.S., updated as of November 2023. The data spans from 2015 to 2025, with historical data up to 2023 and estimated (both operational and planned) data for 2024 and 2025.

Key insights:

1. **Historical Data (2015-2023):**
   - From 2015 to 2020, the installed battery capacity was minimal and relatively stable.
   - Significant growth began in 2021 and continued through 2023.
   - In 2023, there is a delineation between planned and operational capacities, showing an increase in investment and implementation.

2. **Estimated Data (2024-2025):**
   - Substantial growth in battery capacity is expected.
   - A significant projection of increased capacity is evident, reaching approximately 35 gigawatts in 2024 and around 45 gigawatts in 2025.

3. **Source and Data Reference:**
   - The data is sourced from the U.S. Energy Information Administration's "Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory" and is based on Form EIA-860M.

Summary:
The U.S.'s cumulative installed battery capacity has witnessed consistent growth since 2020, with major surges beginning in 2021. The capacity is projected to expand significantly through 2025, illustrating a strong upward trend in battery storage investment and deployment.
