The provided graph titled "Figure 2: Post-COVID Payroll Gap" depicts the number of nonfarm payroll jobs in millions from 2007 to October 2022. The blue solid line represents the actual nonfarm payrolls, while the dashed line indicates the pre-COVID 'trend' in job growth.

Key observations from the graph are:

1. From 2007 to early 2020, the number of nonfarm payroll jobs showed a consistent upward trend, dipping around 2009 presumably due to the financial crisis, and then recovering steadily.
2. By February 2020, just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the number of nonfarm payroll jobs peaked.
3. There was a significant drop in nonfarm payroll jobs in early 2020, right after the pandemic began, indicating a sharp economic downturn.
4. Following the initial drop, the number of jobs began to recover but did not follow the pre-COVID trend line.
5. By October 2022, the number of nonfarm payrolls was still below the pre-COVID trend line, resulting in a gap of 5.8 million jobs, which is a 3.7 percent deficit compared to where employment levels were expected to be based on the trend.

In summary, the graph illustrates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employment in terms of a drastic drop in jobs followed by a partial recovery. However, this recovery has not yet returned to the pre-pandemic trend level, leaving a notable gap in employment.
