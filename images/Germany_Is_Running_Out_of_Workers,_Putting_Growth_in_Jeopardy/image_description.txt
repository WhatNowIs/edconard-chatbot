The provided chart is a projection of Germany's labor force potential under various scenarios, modeled to illustrate the impact of migration and employment rates on the labor market from 1990 to 2060. Here are the key points:

1. **Baseline** (Black Line): Represents the labor force trend if the 1990-2020 average trendline continues. This projection shows a steady increase in the labor force, potentially reaching around 55 million by 2060.

2. **Scenario 1** (Magenta Line): Shows the labor force with a constant employment rate and no net migration. Under this scenario, the labor force is expected to decline significantly, potentially shrinking to below 40 million by 2060.

3. **Scenario 2** (Blue Line): Projects the labor force with a projected employment rate and no net migration. This scenario also shows a notable decline, though slightly less severe than Scenario 1, with the labor force reducing to approximately 35 million by 2060.

4. **Scenario 3** (Yellow Line): Models the labor force with a projected employment rate along with an annual net migration of 100,000 people. In this scenario, the labor force still decreases but at a slower pace, potentially stabilizing around 40 million by 2060.

5. **Scenario 4** (Green Line): Projects the labor force with an employment rate increase and an annual net migration of 400,000 people. This scenario shows the labor force stabilizing around 45-50 million by 2060, indicating a healthier maintenance of the labor market.

**Source and Note**:
- The data comes from the Institute for Labor Market and Vocational Research.
- The projected employment rate includes increased labor participation rates among older people and women.

**Summary**:
Without significant migration, Germany's labor force is projected to decline dramatically under the scenarios provided. The most optimistic scenario (Scenario 4) involves a projected employment rate increase and substantial annual net migration, which maintains workforce levels close to the baseline trend. This highlights the critical role of migration and increased labor participation in sustaining Germany's labor force.
