The provided graph is a line chart titled "Regular price index, by quartile" that shows the matched-model regular price indexes for products in quartiles of average unit price in 2019 for the United States, spanning from January 2019 to April 2023. 

Key points:
1. **Quartiles**:
   - **Q1 (cheapest)**: Represented by a solid red line.
   - **Q2**: Represented by a dashed green line.
   - **Q3**: Represented by a dash-dot orange line.
   - **Q4 (most expensive)**: Represented by a dotted blue line.

2. **Trend**:
   - All quartiles start with indices close to 100 in early 2019.
   - From 2019 to 2020, all quartiles maintain similar indices with slight oscillations.
   - Beginning in early 2021, all indices begin to rise sharply.
   - The increasing trend continues until the end of the observed period in April 2023.

3. **Difference in Price Index**:
   - While all quartiles follow a similar upward trend, Q1 (cheapest) consistently has the highest index and Q4 (most expensive) consistently has the lowest index.
   - By April 2023, Q1 peaks at just below 130, Q2 and Q3 at around 125 and 120, respectively, and Q4 at close to 115.

This graph illustrates how prices across different product quartiles have increased similarly over the past few years, with cheaper products (Q1) experiencing a more significant relative price increase compared to the more expensive products (Q4).
