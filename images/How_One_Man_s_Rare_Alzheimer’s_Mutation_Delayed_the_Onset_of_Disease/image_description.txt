The image is an electron microscope capture showing a detailed view of an amyloid plaque and tau fibers (dark pink lines) in the brain of a person with Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid plaques are insoluble aggregates of beta-amyloid protein. These characteristics are indicative of Alzheimer's disease, which is marked by such protein deposits disrupting cell function.
