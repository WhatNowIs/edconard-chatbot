The image features two bar graphs illustrating the relationship between the deficit and the change in the debt-to-GDP ratio over select periods. Each graph compares the deficit (shown in blue) and debt ratio change (shown in red) as percentages of GDP.

### Graph A: Example Years
- **2005:** 
  - **Deficit:** 2.5% of GDP
  - **Debt Ratio Change:** 0.1% of GDP
- **2024 (projected):**
  - **Deficit:** 6.7% of GDP
  - **Debt Ratio Change:** 1.7% of GDP

### Graph B: Pre-Great-Recession Years versus the Next Decade
- **2003-2007 (historical):**
  - **Deficit:** 2.4% of GDP
  - **Debt Ratio Change:** 0.5% of GDP
- **2024-2034 (projected):**
  - **Deficit:** 6.3% of GDP
  - **Debt Ratio Change:** 2.3% of GDP

### Key Insights:
- In both graphs, the deficit as a percent of GDP significantly exceeds the change in the debt-to-GDP ratio.
- The projected figures for 2024 and 2024-2034 show a notable increase in both the deficit and the debt ratio change compared to historical values.
- The disparity between the deficit and the debt ratio change increases over time, indicating that the deficit is growing much faster than the debt-to-GDP ratio is changing.

### Notes:
- The deficit includes the primary deficit plus net interest.
- The change in the debt-to-GDP ratio equals the difference in the debt-to-GDP ratio between the end of one year and the end of the prior year.
- Historical data are sourced from the CBO (Congressional Budget Office) and OMB (Office of Management and Budget) tables, while next-decade projections also come from the CBO.

This analysis highlights the growing fiscal imbalance, indicating that future deficits are expected to rise substantially relative to GDP, outpacing the rate of change in the debt-to-GDP ratio.
