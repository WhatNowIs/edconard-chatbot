The image is a scatter plot titled "D. Share Successor Revenue." The x-axis represents the "Novelty Decile," which ranges from 0 to 10, while the y-axis represents the "Total Successor Revenue Share," which ranges from 0 to 0.2.

Key points from the scatter plot include:

1. **Positive Correlation**: There is a general upward trend indicated by the line of best fit. As the Novelty Decile increases, so does the Total Successor Revenue Share.
   
2. **Data Points Distribution**: The scatter plot consists of individual data points that are spread across different values of the Novelty Decile. While there is variability, the trend suggests higher novelty deciles correspond to higher revenue shares.

3. **Outliers**: There are a few notable outliers, particularly at the higher revenue shares around the lower and upper deciles, suggesting that some highly novel products have captured a significantly larger share of successor revenue.

In summary, the plot indicates that higher novelty deciles are associated with higher successor revenue shares, though there is some variability in the data. This suggests that more novel innovations tend to generate a larger share of successor revenue.
