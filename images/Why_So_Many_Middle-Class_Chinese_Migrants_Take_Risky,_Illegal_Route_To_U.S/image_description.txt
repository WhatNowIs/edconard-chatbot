The image is a bar chart depicting the net migration from China, showing the number of people leaving the country (net outflows) from the year 2000 to 2023. Key points from the chart include:

1. **Consistent Outflow:** There is a consistent net outflow of people from China each year from 2000 to 2023. This is indicated by the bars, which all fall below the zero line (representing more people leaving than entering).
   
2. **Surge Post-Pandemic:** The net outflows surged quickly after the pandemic years (highlighted in the chart), presumably 2020-2021. 

3. **Historical Trends:** During the earlier years, especially in the early 2000s (e.g., around 2000-2001), the outflows were especially significant, nearing 600,000 people in some years.

4. **Recent Trends:** In the recent years post-pandemic, particularly around 2022 and 2023, there's a noticeable increase in the number of people leaving, although the exact numbers aren't provided in the summary.

The data source is the U.N. Population Division World Population Prospects. The chart effectively illustrates the trend of increasing migration from China, particularly noting the sharp rise after the pandemic period.
