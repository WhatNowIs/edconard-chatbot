This image, sourced from the Louisiana Department of Insurance, depicts a significant surge in home insurance premiums in Louisiana from 2018 to 2022. The title "Louisiana Insurance Rates Surge" suggests that the increase is largely due to a dwindling number of underwriters following back-to-back storms.

The data is visualized in a bar graph that highlights the annual percentage increase in average home insurance premiums over five years. The bars show the following respective increases:
- 2018: Slight increase, near 0%
- 2019: Slightly higher increase, but still below 2%
- 2020: Similar increase to 2019
- 2021: Noticeable increase, just above 5%
- 2022: Significant surge, nearly reaching 20%

This trend indicates that the average home insurance premiums in Louisiana rose dramatically in recent years, particularly spiking in 2022. The graph underscores the impact of consecutive storms and a reduced number of underwriters on the insurance market.
