The image illustrates a chart comparing U.S. import volumes from the EU+UK and China from January 2020 to mid-2022. The chart, sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau, shows that U.S. imports from the EU+UK (depicted by a blue line) have surpassed those from China (represented by red bars) over this period. The trend indicates a significant shift in U.S. import patterns, with a substantial increase in imports from Europe relative to China. Beginning around mid-2021, imports from the EU+UK consistently exceeded those from China, suggesting a notable "Transatlantic Trade Boom." The value axis on the right measure the import volumes in billions of dollars, highlighting the magnitude of this shift.
