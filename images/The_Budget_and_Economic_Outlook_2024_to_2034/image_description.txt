The image is a graph (Figure 1-1) showing the Total Deficit, Net Interest Outlays, and Primary Deficit as a percentage of GDP from 1974 to a projected 2034. The data source is the Congressional Budget Office.

### Summary:

1. **Total Deficit & Components**:
   - The total deficit is the amount by which government outlays exceed revenues.
   - It is broken into two components: "Net Interest Outlays" and the "Primary Deficit."
   - **Net Interest Outlays**: Payments on government debt, shown in a dark pink shade on the graph.
   - **Primary Deficit**: The deficit excluding interest payments, depicted in light pink.

2. **Historical Trends**:
   - Primarily positive values indicating deficits have been common, with notable peaks in the early 1980s, late 2000s, and early 2020s.
   - Rare instances of a primary surplus (negative values) are shown, particularly in the late 1990s to early 2000s.

3. **Projected Trends**:
   - The deficit is expected to increase, reaching 6.1% of GDP by 2034.
   - Net interest payments grow relative to GDP, hitting 3.9% in 2034.
   - Primary deficits are projected to rise in 2025, then decline for a few years, followed by another increase.

4. **Projections & Adjustments**:
   - Projections are adjusted for timing shifts that occur due to the fiscal year starting on October 1st.
   - Historical data goes back as far as records allow and is adjusted similarly.
  
5. **Explanation of Terms**:
   - **Primary deficit/surplus**: Excludes net interest payments.
   - **Deficits and Surpluses**: Positive values in the chart indicate deficits, and negative values indicate surpluses.
