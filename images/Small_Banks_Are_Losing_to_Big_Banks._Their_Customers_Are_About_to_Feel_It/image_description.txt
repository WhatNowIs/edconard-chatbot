The image presents two bar charts detailing the weekly changes in deposits for small and large banks over a specified time period from October 2022 to the beginning of 2023. 

### Summary:

- **Small Banks**:
  - The bar chart for small banks shows fluctuations in deposit changes, with several instances of both positive and negative changes.
  - Notable observations include substantial declines in deposits, particularly towards early 2023, where the most significant drop reaches nearly $100 billion.

- **Large Banks**:
  - The chart for large banks similarly displays variations in deposits, with both increases and decreases observed over the same time period.
  - A dramatic change is seen towards early 2023, where deposits surge by nearly $100 billion in one week. This notable increase contrasts with the scattered smaller declines and increments seen earlier.

### Additional Notes:
- The data source is the Federal Reserve, as reported by Nate Rattner from The Wall Street Journal.
- Large banks are defined as the top 25 ranked by domestic assets, while small banks are those not in the top 25.

These charts illustrate the volatility and notable shifts in bank deposits, with a particular emphasis on substantial changes occurring in early 2023.
