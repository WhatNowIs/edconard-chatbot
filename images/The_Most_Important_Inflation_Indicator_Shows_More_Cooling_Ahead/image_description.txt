The chart is titled "The Great Rent Disinflation" and illustrates the change in rent growth over time, showing that rent growth has peaked and that leading indicators suggest further decelerations. It includes four different indicators of rent prices:

1. **CPI: Rent of Primary Residence** (Yellow line)
2. **New Tenant Rent Index, Lagged 1 Year** (Green line)
3. **Zillow Observed Rent Index, Lagged 1 Year** (Red line)
4. **ApartmentList Median New Lease, Lagged 1 Year** (Blue line)

The timeline spans from 2018 to mid-2024, and the y-axis represents the percent change from a year ago, ranging from 0% to 20%. The graph, which uses data from BLS, Zillow, and ApartmentList, shows the following key trends:

- All indicators display a general upward trend starting around 2021, peaking between mid-2021 and early 2022.
- After peaking, there is a notable decline in the growth rate of rents, indicating a slowing down or reduction in the rate at which rents were increasing.
- As of mid-2023, the percentage change from a year ago has moderated significantly, suggesting disinflation in rent prices.

This data implies that the rapid growth in rents that occurred in the early 2020s is stabilizing, leading to a slower rate of rent increases.
