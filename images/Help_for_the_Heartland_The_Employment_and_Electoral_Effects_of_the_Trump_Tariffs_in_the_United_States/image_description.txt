The scatter plot depicted in Figure 4 illustrates the predicted effect of tariff exposure on the employment-population ratio against its effects on the Republican vote share in presidential elections. The x-axis represents the predicted combined effect of import tariffs, retaliatory tariffs, and subsidy exposure on the employment-population ratio. The y-axis shows the predicted effect of these same factors on the Republican vote share in presidential elections.

Key observations:
- There is a cluster of data points mostly concentrated around the origin of the axes, with a positive trend where higher predicted effects on the employment-population ratio correspond to higher predicted effects on the Republican vote share.
- The data points are distributed across four quadrants divided by red axes at (0,0), indicating different effects on employment and vote shares.
- Most data points lie in the first quadrant, suggesting a positive correlation between higher predicted employment effects and increased Republican vote shares.

Notes provide additional context:
- The shown prediction is based on each Commuting Zoneâ€™s (CZ) exposure as of December 2019, scaled by the regression coefficients from Table 1.
- It summarizes the combined effect of trade war variables on the Republican vote share by scaling the same exposures with regression coefficients from Table 5.
- The predictions aggregate CZs into 40 bins based on employment values for a more comprehensive depiction.

In summary, the chart suggests a positive correlation between the effects of tariffs and subsidies on employment and Republican vote shares, reflecting complex economic and political impacts of trade policies.
