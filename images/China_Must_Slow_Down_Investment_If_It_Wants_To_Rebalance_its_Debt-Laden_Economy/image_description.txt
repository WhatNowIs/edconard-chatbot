The image is a line graph showing Chinaâ€™s debt to GDP ratio from December 1995 to June 2021, broken down into three categories: Household (black line), Non-financial corporations (dark gray line), and General government (light gray line).

### Key Points:
1. **Household Debt**:
   - There is a gradual increase in household debt to GDP from 1995 until around 2011.
   - After 2011, the household debt to GDP ratio increases sharply and continues this trend up to 2021.
   - By June 2021, it is well above the 50% mark.

2. **Non-financial Corporations Debt**:
   - This has been the highest among the three categories throughout the period.
   - It shows a steady increase from 1995, reaching a peak around 2016-2017, fluctuating slightly afterward.
   - By June 2021, it is slightly below 150% of GDP.

3. **General Government Debt**:
   - The general government debt remains relatively stable and low compared to the other two categories until around 2008.
   - A notable increase starts around the 2008 financial crisis, reflecting government response to the crisis, and continues to rise steadily thereafter.
   - By June 2021, it approaches the 75% mark.
