The image presents three charts titled "Bubble Gauge (Percentile)" and compares stock market bubbles from different eras. Below is a summary of the charts:

1. **1920s Bubble**:
   - Timeframe: 1922-1932.
   - The bubble peaks close to 100% around 1928-1929.
   - There is a sharp decline following the peak, indicating the crash leading into the Great Depression.

2. **1990s Bubble**:
   - Timeframe: 1992-2002.
   - The bubble peaks again near 100% around 1998-2000.
   - The gauge shows a significant drop after 2000, illustrating the burst of the Dot-com Bubble.

3. **Today**:
   - Timeframe: 2014-2024.
   - Displays a peak around 2021, labeled as a bubble but does not reach as high as previous bubbles, peaking around 60%.
   - The gauge shows a decrease after the peak, with current levels stating "Not particularly bubbly today".

Overall, the charts illustrate historic and recent stock market bubbles, showing high percentile peaks during the 1920s and 1990s, followed by significant declines. The current market reflects a more moderate bubble with less extreme highs and no drastic drop-off recently, suggesting the market is less "bubbly" today compared to past crises.
