The image illustrates the impact of liberal planning regulations on housing development and affordability in Texan cities compared to Californian cities. Key points from the image are:

1. **New Dwelling Approvals Per 1,000 People**:
   - Texan cities, particularly Austin and Houston, have consistently approved more new dwellings per 1,000 people compared to Californian cities such as San Francisco.
   - Austin, for instance, has shown a stark increase in new dwelling approvals, peaking significantly higher compared to other cities.

2. **Change in Real House Prices Since January 2000**:
   - House prices in Californian cities, especially San Francisco, have surged much higher compared to Texan cities. San Francisco's real house prices have increased by over 150%.
   - In contrast, Texan cities, including Austin and Houston, have experienced more moderate increases in house prices, generally remaining below a 100% increase over the same period.

The data sourced from FT analysis, the US Census Bureau, and Zillow, suggests that more liberal planning regulations in Texan cities have facilitated a greater supply of new homes, making housing more affordable compared to the more restrictive Californian cities.
