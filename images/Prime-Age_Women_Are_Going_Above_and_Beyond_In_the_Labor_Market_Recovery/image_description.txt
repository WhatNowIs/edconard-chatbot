The image presents a line graph titled "Figure 1: Prime-Age Women's Labor Force Participation Rate 1990 to June 2023, by Age of Youngest Child." The data is segmented by various categories of prime-age women based on whether they have children and the age group of their youngest child.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Women without Minor Children:**
   - These women consistently show the highest labor force participation rate, fluctuating around the 80-85% mark throughout the examined years.

2. **Women with Youngest Child Aged 13-18:**
   - Their participation rate is slightly lower than that of women without minor children, also hovering around the 80% mark with notable fluctuations similar to the other categories.

3. **Women with Youngest Child Aged 5-12:**
   - Their participation rate is marginally lower than those with older children but higher than those with the youngest children, with values mostly in the mid-to-high 70% range.

4. **All Prime-Age Women:**
   - This category includes the aggregated participation rates of all the women, showing a mixed pattern as expected with a general downward trend post-2000, indicating that fewer women participated in the labor force.

5. **Women with Youngest Child Aged 0-4:**
   - This group displays the lowest participation rates amongst all categories, starting below 65% in the 1990s and gradually rising close to 70% by 2023.

**Trends Over Time:**
- From a broader perspective, there is an upward trend in labor force participation among all groups toward the end of the observed timeline after the significant dip during the pre-pandemic period.
- The graph illustrates periodic fluctuations indicating the economic cycles impacting employment patterns.
- Overall, women with younger children tend to have lower labor force participation rates compared to those with older children or no children at all.

**Source Information:**
- The data is derived from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and incorporates authors' calculations.
- Participation rates are not seasonally adjusted, and adjustments for 2012-2022 are backcasted using Census revisions as described in Bauer et al. (2023). Horizontal lines represent pre-pandemic peak participation levels.

**Conclusion:**
- The labor force participation rate among prime-age women varies significantly based on the age of their youngest child, with those with no minor children participating the most and those with very young children participating the least.
- There have been noticeable fluctuations and overall growth in participation rates since the early 1990s.
