The image shows a bubble map illustrating the number of migrants with new immigration court cases in 2023 across various counties in the United States. Key details include:

- The map highlights counties with notable numbers of new migrants.
- Bubbles represent the numbers of migrants, with larger bubbles indicating a higher number of migrants.
- Darker blue shades indicate counties where new migrants make up more than 2% of the population.
- The highest concentrations of new migrants are seen in counties like Los Angeles, Denver, Harris, Miami-Dade, Bronx, Queens, Kings, and Cook.
- Some addresses in court records include detention centers within these counties.
- The source of the data is the Department of Justice EOIR case data, released after FOIA requests by TRAC at Syracuse University.

This visualization underscores how certain counties, particularly major urban areas, are seeing significant proportions of new migrants relative to their populations.
