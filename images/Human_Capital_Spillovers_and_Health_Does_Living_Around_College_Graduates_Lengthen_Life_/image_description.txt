The graph presents the relationship between the percentage of college graduates in an area and the all-cause mortality rate per 100,000 people for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010. It shows a clear negative correlation between the level of area human capital (percentage of college graduates) and adjusted mortality rates.

Key observations:
1. **Downward Trend**: In all three years (1990, 2000, 2010), higher percentages of college graduates are associated with lower mortality rates.
2. **Decreasing Mortality Rates Over Time**: The mortality rates have decreased over time for each given percentage of college graduates.
   - **1990**: Represented by diamond markers with a fitted line slope coefficient of -4.4 (with standard error 0.97), significant at the ***p<0.01 level.
   - **2000**: Represented by circle markers with a slope of -6.8 (standard error 0.73), also significant at the ***p<0.01 level.
   - **2010**: Represented by triangle markers with a slope of -9.7 (standard error 0.97), significant at the ***p<0.01 level.
3. **Coefficients Interpretation**: Over the years, the slopes of the fitted lines become steeper, indicating that the impact of increasing the percentage of college graduates on reducing mortality rates has become stronger over time.
4. **Adjusted Data**: The mortality rates are adjusted for age and sex within each bin to ensure more accurate relationships.

In summary, the graph underscores a significant and strengthening relationship between higher educational attainment within an area and reduced all-cause mortality rates. This relationship has become more pronounced over the two decades from 1990 to 2010.
