- The line graph shows two metrics: Year over Year (Y/Y) and Four Quarters over Four Quarters (4Q/4Q) growth rates.
- From 2005 to 2023, the graph reveals fluctuations in income growth, with significant drops around the 2008 financial crisis and slight dips around 2020, indicating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Post-2020, the data shows a brief period of higher growth before stabilizing back to pre-pandemic norms.
