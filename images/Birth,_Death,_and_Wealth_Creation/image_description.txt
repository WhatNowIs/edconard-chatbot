1. **Fluctuating Trends**: The median age at IPO exhibits significant year-to-year fluctuations over the observed period. 
   
2. **Average Age**: There is a dashed line representing the average median age at IPO, which appears to be around 8 years.

3. **Historical Peaks and Troughs**: 
   - There were notable peaks in the median age around the late 1990s, mid-2000s, and early 2010s where median ages reached 10 years or slightly higher.
   - Significant dips are present around 2001 and 2008, where the median age fell close to or below 4 years.

4. **Recent Trends**: From around 2012 to 2022, the median age at IPO has remained more stable and closer to the average line compared to earlier periods.

Overall, the median age at IPO has shown variability over the decades but has tended to average out around 8 years. The graph highlights periods of increased and decreased median ages, suggesting shifts in the market and IPO environments at different times. The data source is cited as Jay R.
