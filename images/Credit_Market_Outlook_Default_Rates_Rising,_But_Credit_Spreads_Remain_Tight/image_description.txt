The image provided is a graph showing the default rates of U.S. speculative-grade loans (represented by a green line) and high-yield (HY) bonds (represented by a blue line) over time, with data from Moody's Analytics and analysis by Apollo Chief Economist. The timeline spans from January 1997 to July 2023.

Key observations from the graph:

1. **Historical Peaks**: 
   - There were significant peaks in default rates for both loans and HY bonds around the early 2000s (2001-2002), the late 2000s (2008-2009), and the early 2020s (2020-2021).
   - The highest spike in HY bond default rates occurred during 2009, reaching above 14%. Correspondingly, loan default rates also peaked during this period but at a lower rate, approximately around 10%.

2. **Recent Trends**:
   - The graph shows a sharp increase in both loan and HY bond default rates starting around early 2022.
   - By July 2023, the default rates for loans have risen to approximately 4%, while for HY bonds, they are slightly higher, approaching 6%.

3. **Correlation with Federal Reserve Rate Changes**:
   - There is a noticeable increase in default rates shortly after the U.S. Federal Reserve started raising rates, as indicated by the vertical dashed line. This suggests a potential correlation between rate hikes and increasing default rates.

4. **Recessions**: 
   - The gray shaded areas on the graph likely represent recession periods in the U.S., correlating to high default rates during economic downturns (e.g., early 2000s dot-com bubble, 2008 global financial crisis, and 2020 COVID-19 pandemic).

In summary, the graph indicates that the U.S. is entering a new default cycle, with increasing speculative-grade default rates for both loans and high-yield bonds. This uptick started around early 2022, likely influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate hikes. Historical data suggest that default rates tend to spike during economic downturns and periods of financial stress.
