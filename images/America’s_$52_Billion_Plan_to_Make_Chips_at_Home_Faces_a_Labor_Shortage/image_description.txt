This chart titled "A Growing Worker Deficit" shows the trends in the U.S. labor force compared to U.S. labor demand from 2012 to 2022. The U.S. labor force is represented by a black line, while U.S. labor demand is represented by a red line.

### Key Points:
1. **Labor Force and Demand Trends (2012-2020):**
   - From 2012 to around the end of 2019, the U.S. labor force and labor demand grew steadily and remained close to each other.
   
2. **COVID-19 Impact (2020):**
   - In early 2020, there was a sharp decline in both labor force and labor demand, which is likely associated with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. **Recovery and Divergence (2021-2022):**
   - Post early 2020, both labor force and labor demand began to recover.
   - However, there is a notable divergence starting 2021 where labor demand (red line) surpasses the labor force (black line), indicating a growing worker deficit.
   - By 2022, the labor demand has significantly outpaced the labor force, indicating a substantial gap between the number of people employed plus total nonfarm job openings (labor demand) and the actual labor force.

### Summary:
From 2012 to 2019, the U.S. labor force kept pace with labor demand. However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant drop in both in early 2020. Since then, labor demand has rebounded more sharply compared to the labor force, creating a significant worker deficit by 2022. This suggests an increasing gap between the number of job openings and the availability of workers.
