The image depicts a line graph showing the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from a year earlier, with data sourced from the Labor Department. The graph covers the period from 2019 to early 2023.

Key observations from the graph are:

1. **Overall Consumer Price Index:**
   - Represented by the grey line.
   - Saw a significant increase from early 2021, peaking around mid-2022.
   - As of early 2023, it shows a year-over-year increase of +6.4%.
  
2. **Core Consumer Price Index (excluding food and energy):**
   - Represented by the purple line.
   - Follows a similar upward trend starting from early 2021.
   - Also peaked around mid-2022 but shows a slightly less pronounced increase compared to the overall CPI.
   - As of early 2023, it shows a year-over-year increase of +5.6%.

3. **Recession Period:**
   - Indicated by a shaded vertical strip approximately around early 2020, which aligns with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, causing significant economic disruptions.
