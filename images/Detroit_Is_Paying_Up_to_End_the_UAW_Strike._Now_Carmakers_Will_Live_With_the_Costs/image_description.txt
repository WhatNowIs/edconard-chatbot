The graph shows U.S. motor vehicle sales from 2015 to 2022, classified into four categories: domestic light trucks (in dark blue), foreign light trucks (in red), domestic cars (in light blue), and foreign cars (in light orange). The data is seasonally adjusted to an annual rate and sourced from the Commerce Department.

Key observations include:

1. **Domestic Light Trucks**: The sales have consistently been the highest among the categories, fluctuating around the 8 to 10 million units mark. A significant dip is observed in early 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the trend appears to have recovered and stabilized later.

2. **Domestic Cars**: The sales have been on a steady decline from around 5 million units in 2015 to below 2 million units by 2022.

3. **Foreign Light Trucks**: These have shown a gradual increase from about 1.5 million units in 2015 to just under 2.5 million units in 2022.

4. **Foreign Cars**: Sales have remained relatively stable, fluctuating around the 1.5 million units mark over the years.

5. **Impact of COVID-19**: All categories experienced noticeable dips in early 2020 due to the pandemic, but the extent of recovery varies, with domestic light trucks showing a strong rebound.

In summary, the U.S. motor vehicle market has seen dominant sales of domestic light trucks, a long-term decline in domestic car sales, and gradual increases in foreign light truck sales, while foreign car sales have remained fairly stable.
