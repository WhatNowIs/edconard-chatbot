- **Small banks**: A minimal decrease slightly below zero.
- **Regional banks**: A slight decrease, greater than that of small banks but less than other categories.
- **Super-regional banks**: The largest decrease in deposits, approximately $550 billion.
- **Large banks**: A significant decrease, slightly below $200 billion.
