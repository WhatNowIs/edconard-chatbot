The image is a chart titled "Deceleration at Last?" and examines the changes in average hourly worker pay, annualized, for different categories of workers from 2007 to 2023. The categories are:
- Retail, leisure, and hospitality (nonsupervisory only, month/month)
- All other nonsupervisory workers (m/m)
- Supervisory workers (m/m)

Additionally, it looks at trends on a moving average basis:
- Retail, leisure, and hospitality (3-month moving average)
- All other nonsupervisory workers (3-month moving average)
- Supervisory workers (6-month moving average)

Key points summarized from the chart:
1. Wage growth fluctuates widely but has varied across different worker categories.
2. The red line, representing all other nonsupervisory workers, indicates a recent slowdown in wage growth.
3. In general, wage growth peaks notably around 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic period.
4. Despite short-term variations, long-term trends suggest potential deceleration in monthly wage growth for most Americans, which could impact consumer spending and inflation.
5. The source of the data is the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the calculations are by Matthew Klein.

This chart contributes to understanding how wage trends are impacting the broader economy, highlighting a potential deceleration in wage growth that may ease underlying inflation pressures.
