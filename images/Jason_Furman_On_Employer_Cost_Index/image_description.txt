2. **12-month Change** (represented by an orange line)

### Summary of Trends:
- **2007-2011**: Both the 3-month and 12-month changes saw a general decline, reflecting reduced growth rates in private compensation.
- **2011-2019**: The 12-month change displayed a relatively stable but moderate upward trajectory, typically hovering between 2% and 3%.
- **2020**: The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic initially caused notable fluctuations in the 3-month change.
- **2021**: Both the 3-month and 12-month changes exhibited significant increases, with the 12-month change peaking at around 6%.

### Key Observations:

- The 3-month change displays more volatility, particularly during economic downturns like the 2008 Financial Crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
