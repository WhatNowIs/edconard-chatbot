The image is a bar chart that illustrates the projected changes in determinants of the neutral interest rate (r*) and its expected impact over the next decade. The main elements discussed are:

1. **Government Debt**: Expected to have the highest positive impact (around 0.75 percentage points) on the neutral rate.
2. **Green Investment**: Anticipated to have a positive impact (around 0.5 percentage points).
3. **Cost of Capital**: Projected to have a small negative impact (around -0.1 percentage points).
4. **Demographics**: Expected to have a larger negative impact (approximately -0.25 percentage points).

Additionally, productivity scenarios are analyzed:
- **CBO Potential**: A slight negative impact.
- **With AI Productivity Boost**: A significant positive impact (around 1.25 percentage points).

**Total Impact**:
- **No Boost**: Total impact without AI productivity boost is projected to be about 0.5 percentage points.
- **With Boost**: Total impact with AI productivity boost is projected to be around 1.25 percentage points.

The data for the analysis is sourced from the Congressional Budget Office and Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research. The overall conclusion suggests that the neutral rate is expected to rise somewhat in the next decade, with significant contributions expected from government debt, green investments, and potential gains from AI productivity boosts.
