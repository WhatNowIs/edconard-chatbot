The image provides a visual representation of the risk of insurance corrections due to fire, flood, or wind within the United States by county, as estimated for the year 2023. The map uses a gradient of colors to denote the number of properties at risk in each county, ranging from 0 (lightest color) to 9,000 (darkest color).

Key observations from the map:
- Los Angeles County, California has an estimated 529,000 properties at risk.
- Harris County, Texas has a significantly higher risk with an estimated 1.4 million properties.
- Plaquemines Parish in Louisiana has 15,000 properties at risk.

The map highlights that the risk is not uniformly distributed across the country. Many areas in the Western and Eastern United States show a high concentration of properties at risk. In contrast, some regions, particularly in the central part of the country, have relatively fewer properties at risk or lack data entirely.
