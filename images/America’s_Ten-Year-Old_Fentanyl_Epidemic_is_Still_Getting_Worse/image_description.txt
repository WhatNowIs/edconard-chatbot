The graph illustrates the number of drug-overdose deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2023, measured in thousands (â€™000). The chart tracks deaths from different types of drugs, specifically cocaine, prescription opioids, heroin, methadone, and fentanyl and synthetic opioids.

Key points from the data:
1. **Fentanyl and synthetic opioids (orange line)**: There is a dramatic increase in deaths starting around 2013, surging significantly to become the leading cause of drug-overdose deaths, reaching approximately 70,000 by 2023.
2. **Cocaine (dark blue line)**: The number of deaths from cocaine shows a steady increase from 2013 onward, peaking at around 25,000 deaths by 2023.
3. **Prescription opioids (light blue line)**: Deaths peaked around 2010 but have remained relatively stable or slightly declining in recent years, ending at about 15,000 deaths by 2023.
4. **Heroin (red line)**: After a steady rise until around 2016, deaths began to decline, settling at around 10,000 by 2023.
5. **Methadone (gray line)**: Methadone-related deaths remained relatively low and stable, showing little fluctuation, hovering below 5,000 throughout the period.

Overall, the most notable trend is the explosive rise in deaths from fentanyl and synthetic opioids, significantly surpassing other forms of drugs by 2023. The data is compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
