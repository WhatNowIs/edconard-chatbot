The image is a financial chart from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) comparing different credit spreads from 2000 to 2023. The key indicators shown are:

- ICE BofA BBB US Corporate Index Option-Adjusted Spread (in blue)
- ICE BofA CCC & Lower US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread (in red)
- ICE BofA AA US Corporate Index Option-Adjusted Spread (in green)

Key Observations:

1. **Credit Spread Trends**: 
   - The red line (ICE BofA CCC & Lower US High Yield Index) shows significant peaks during recession periods, notably around 2002, 2008-2009, and 2020, indicative of increased perceived risk during these times.
   - The blue line (ICE BofA BBB US Corporate Index) and green line (ICE BofA AA US Corporate Index) have generally remained lower and more stable, without extreme fluctuations.

2. **Recession Periods**:
   - The shaded areas indicate U.S. recessions (2001, 2007-2009, and 2020), during which the credit spreads, particularly the high yield (red line), widened significantly.
   
3. **Current Spreads**:
   - The message below the chart states, “Credit spreads remain narrow,” suggesting that, as of the most recent data points, the spreads are relatively low and stable compared to past peaks.

Overall, this chart highlights how credit spreads, particularly for high-yield bonds, tend to widen during economic downturns, but are currently at relatively narrow levels, indicating lower perceived credit risk in the market.
