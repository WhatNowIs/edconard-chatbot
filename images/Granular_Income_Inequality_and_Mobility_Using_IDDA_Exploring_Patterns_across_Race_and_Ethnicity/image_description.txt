This image presents Figure 9 from a study on income growth, specifically examining median wage and salary income growth by starting income and race/ethnicity, using data from the CPS, decennial census, and IDDA. The graphs in section (b) titled "Five-year growth" showcase this growth split into six income percentiles (p0p25, p26p50, p51p75, p76p90, and p91p100) over several years, from 2005 to 2013.

Key points include:

1. **Median Income Levels:** The graphs depict the median wage and salary income growth in nominal dollars for six income groups.
2. **Ethnic Groups:** The analysis includes several ethnic groups: White, Black, Hispanic, AIAN (American Indian or Alaska Native), Asian, and NHOPI (Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander).
3. **Trends Over Time:** The data across these years shows general trends and disparities in income growth among different ethnic groups.
4. **Racial/Ethnic Disparities:** The graph highlights differences in income growth rates among various racial and ethnic groups over time. For example, some groups like NHOPI and Asian show higher income growth in certain percentiles compared to others.

The study aims to provide a detailed understanding of how wage and salary incomes have grown across different starting income levels and among various racial and ethnic groups. This information can be critical for policymakers and researchers interested in income inequality and economic mobility.
