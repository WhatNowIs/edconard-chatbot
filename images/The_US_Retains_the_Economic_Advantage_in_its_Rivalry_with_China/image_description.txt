The chart, titled "In industry, the US plus allies and friends are still very large," displays the share of global industry value added (%) from 1995 to 2022. The data is sourced from Capital Economics and the World Bank. Here's a summary:

- The chart is divided into six segments, each representing a different group:
  - US & allies (dark blue)
  - Leans US (light blue)
  - Unaligned (blue)
  - Leans China (burgundy)
  - China & allies (pink)
  
- In 1995, the majority share of global industry value was held by the US & allies, with substantial contributions from the unaligned and much smaller portions for China & allies and countries leaning towards China.

- Over time, the share of US & allies has slightly decreased, while the proportion of China & allies has notably increased.

- The unaligned section has fluctuated but remains a significant portion throughout the period.

- From 2015 onwards, there is a distinct increase in China & allies and countries leaning towards China, while the US & allies maintain a significant but relatively declining share.

- By 2022, China & allies and those leaning towards China have achieved significant shares, reflecting the growing industrial influence of China and its allies globally.

Overall, despite the increasing industrial contributions from China and its allies, the US and its allies still retain a substantial share of global industry value.
