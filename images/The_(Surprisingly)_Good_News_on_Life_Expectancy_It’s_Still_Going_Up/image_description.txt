The image titled "Betting on the Future" features two line graphs showing the life expectancy trends for men and women from 1940 to 2022. The focus is on two types of life expectancy:

1. **Period Life Expectancy**: This reflects death rates in a given year.
2. **Cohort Life Expectancy**: This estimates how long people born in a given year will live, accounting for improved mortality over time.

### Key Observations:

#### Men:
- **Period Life Expectancy** (blue line): 
  - It started around 62 years in 1940.
  - Increased steadily, showing significant growth in the 1950s and 1960s.
  - Continued to rise to about 75 years by 2020 but dipped slightly by 2022.
- **Cohort Life Expectancy** (shaded blue area):
  - Shows a higher expectancy compared to period data, especially noticeable from the 1960s onwards.
  - The spread between cohort and period life expectancy widens over time, indicating improved mortality rates.

#### Women:
- **Period Life Expectancy** (pink line):
  - Started around 67 years in 1940.
  - Followed an upward trend, with noticeable growth similar to men.
  - Reached around 80 years by 2020, with a slight decline visible by 2022.
- **Cohort Life Expectancy** (shaded pink area):
  - Similarly to men, it consistently shows higher values than period expectancy.
  - The gap between cohort and period life expectancy is also wider over time, reflecting ongoing improvements in health and longevity.

### Summary:
Both graphs depict a general increase in life expectancy from 1940 to 2022 for men and women, with cohort life expectancy consistently higher than period life expectancy. The graphs indicate that people can expect to live longer lives if they were born more recently, benefiting from improvements in healthcare and living conditions over time. The data is sourced from the Social Security Administration.
