The graph displays the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Inflation from 2018 to March 2023. It distinguishes between the "Headline" and "Core" inflation rates, expressed as a 6-month percent change at an annual rate.

Key Highlights:

1. **2018-2020 Period**: The inflation rates hovered around 2%, with slight fluctuations.
2. **Early 2020**: A notable decline in inflation due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
3. **2021-2022 Period**: Both Headline and Core inflation rates rose significantly, peaking sharply. Headline inflation, in particular, showed higher volatility and reached over 8% at its peak.
4. **2022-2023 Period**: Both Headline and Core inflation rates showed a downward trend, with Headline inflation decreasing more steeply than Core inflation. As of March 2023, both rates are converging around 4-5%.

Summary:
From 2018 to early 2023, PCE Price Inflation experienced significant fluctuations. A dramatic increase in 2021-2022 was observed, largely attributed to pandemic-related factors, followed by a decline in 2022 and early 2023. The Headline inflation rate demonstrated higher volatility compared to the Core inflation rate throughout the period.
