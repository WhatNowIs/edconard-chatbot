The graph, titled "Exhibit 5. Actual 2022 vs 25th Percentile Projected Funded Ratios in 2032," compares the actual funded ratios of retirement plans in 2022 with the 25th percentile projected funded ratios in 2032. 

Key points:
1. **Funded Ratio Distribution**: The x-axis represents the funded ratio, while the y-axis shows the frequency of occurrences.
2. **Color Coding**: The histogram for the year 2022 is shaded in blue, and the projected data for 2032 is shaded in pink/orange.
3. **Data Source and Calculation**: The data is derived from the Boston College Center for Retirement Research Public Plans Database and involves the author's calculations.

**Observations**:
- In 2022, the funded ratios were generally centered around 0.8.
- The projected funded ratios for 2032 show a spread somewhat similar to 2022 but display a slight trend towards higher funded ratios.
- For both years, the most frequent funded ratio is around 0.8, but projections for 2032 show higher prospects overall compared to 2022.

This histogram illustrates that while current funded ratios are clustered around 0.8, projections into 2032 anticipate slight improvement, though still centered around 0.8, indicating a cautious yet optimistic outlook for retirement plan funding.
