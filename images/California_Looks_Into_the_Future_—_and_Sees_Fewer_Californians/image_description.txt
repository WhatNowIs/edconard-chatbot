The chart, titled "California Population Stagnation," illustrates the estimated and projected population trends in California from 2020 to 2060. It indicates that California's population is expected to be slightly smaller in 2060 compared to 2020. The data, sourced from the California Department of Finance Demographic Research Unit, shows the following key points:

1. In the short term (2020-2022), there is a slight decline.
2. From 2023 onwards, the population is projected to gradually increase, reaching a peak around 2044 at approximately 40 million.
3. After peaking in 2044, the population is expected to decline slightly, leveling off around 39.5 million by 2060, slightly below the population level of 2020.

The chart combines both estimates (2020-2022) and projections (2023-2060) to provide a comprehensive view of California's population dynamics over a 40-year span.
