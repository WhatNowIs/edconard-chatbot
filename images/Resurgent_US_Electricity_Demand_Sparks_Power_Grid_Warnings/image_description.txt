The image from the Financial Times presents an analysis of the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) on the US electricity market, focusing on installed capacity and electricity consumption projections up to 2050. The data compares two scenarios: one with the IRA (light blue lines) and one without (dark blue lines).

**Installed Capacity (GW):**
- **Current Trajectory:** The installed capacity increases steadily from 2021 to 2050.
  - **Without IRA:** The installed capacity rises from approximately 1,000 GW in 2021 to just below 3,000 GW by 2050.
  - **With IRA:** The capacity increase is more pronounced, surpassing 3,000 GW by 2050.

**Electricity Consumption (TWh):**
- **Current Trajectory:** Electricity consumption shows gradual growth from 2021 to 2050.
  - **Without IRA:** Consumption grows slowly from about 4,000 TWh in 2021 to around 6,500 TWh by 2050.
  - **With IRA:** Consumption starts similar to the non-IRA scenario but shows a significant rise post-2040, reaching around 8,000 TWh by 2050.

**Summary:**
The implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act is forecasted to markedly boost both the installed capacity and electricity consumption in the US by 2050. Installed capacity is projected to exceed 3,000 GW with the IRA, while electricity consumption is expected to reach 8,000 TWh. These figures underscore the IRA's potential to drive substantial growth and transformation in the US electricity sector.
