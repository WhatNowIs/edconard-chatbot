The image is a stacked bar chart titled "Housing Completions per Year," depicting data from 1968 to 2022. The chart categorizes housing completions into four types: Single Family (red), 2 to 4 units (cyan), 5+ units (blue), and Manufactured Homes (yellow).

Key observations:

1. **Fluctuations Over Time**:
   - There are significant fluctuations in total housing completions over the years.
   - Peaks are seen around the mid-1970s, mid-1980s, late 1990s, mid-2000s, and a gradual rise from 2012 to 2022.

2. **Single Family Homes**:
   - Single family homes consistently represent the largest portion of total completions each year.
   - Their volume appears relatively stable from the late 1960s until the early 2000s, but shows a decline around 2008 and then a gradual increase until 2022.

3. **2 to 4 Units and 5+ Units**:
   - These types of completions (cyan and blue) show variable but smaller contributions compared to single family homes.
   - The number of 5+ unit completions especially spikes in the mid-1970s, mid-1980s, and mid-2000s.

4. **Manufactured Homes**:
   - Manufactured homes (yellow) show notable peaks during the mid-1970s and mid-2000s.
   - Contributions from manufactured homes declined significantly post-2000 and show minor recovery in recent years.

5. **Economic Factors**:
   - The chart reflects economic cycles, with dips notably around early 1980s, early 1990s, and the sharp dip around 2008 corresponding to the financial crisis.
   - There's a steady recovery trend starting around 2012, indicating an improved housing market up to 2022.

Overall, the chart illustrates the dynamic nature of housing completions in the U.S. over more than five decades, highlighting the dominance of single-family homes and the impact of economic cycles on housing production.
