The black and white image depicts close-up of a person's hands. The individual is holding a small plastic bag containing what appears to be a white substance, and a metal container in the other hand. Their nails are dirty. In the background, part of a shirt with the words "AMERICAN TRADITION SINCE" and stars underneath, above which are wavy stripes, reminiscent of an American flag, can be seen. The details suggest a theme involving Americana and perhaps a commentary on substance use or socio-economic conditions.
