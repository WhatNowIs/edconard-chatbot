The two charts provide an analysis of AI-related capital expenditures and cloud services capital expenditures as a percentage of GDP.

**Left Chart - "Revenue (Idx to Nov '22)**
1. **AI-Related Capex**: There is a notation indicating that AI-related capital expenditures are starting to increase. However, outside certain companies in the AI chip ecosystem (notably NVIDIA), there has not yet been a significant broad-based increase in revenues for companies heavily invested in AI.
2. **Revenue Trends**: 
   - **Chips (Red Line)**: There is a sharp increase in revenue observed starting from around July 2023, reaching around a 50% rise by mid-2024.
   - **Power (Black Line) and Cloud (Blue Line)**: These sectors show steady growth without any significant spikes.
   - **Non-Chip Data Center Equipment (Green Line)**: This shows some volatility but generally trends downward from mid-2023.
   - **S&P 500 (Dashed Orange Line)**: This line is relatively flat, representing stability in the overall market index.

**Right Chart - "Cloud Services Capex (%GDP)**
1. **Capex Growth in Cloud Services**: Cloud service companies' capital expenditures as a percentage of GDP have increased by approximately 15 basis points (bps) in the past year. This rate of growth is similar to other strong capex years in the last decade, a period marked by increased spending on priorities other than AI.

**Summary**
AI-related capital expenditures are starting to rise, primarily driven by companies within the AI chip ecosystem. While broader revenue spikes for AI investments are not yet observed, sectors like chips are experiencing significant revenue growth. Cloud services are also increasing their capital expenditures as a percentage of GDP at a rate comparable to notable past growth periods, with a substantial uptick seen in recent years.
