The image is a graph titled "Demand, Destroyed," illustrating Chinese retail sales of consumer goods and meals, measured in rolling 12-month sums in CNY trillions, from 2015 to 2023. Key points summarized from the graph and accompanying text are:

1. **Title and Observation**:
   - The title "Demand, Destroyed" signals a significant decline in consumer spending.
   - Chinese consumer spending dropped sharply during the pandemic, remaining low for much of 2020, and has stagnated since mid-2021.

2. **Gap Between Actual Spending and Trend**:
   - There is a noticeable gap between actual spending (solid blue line) and the pre-pandemic trend (dotted red line) from 2016 to 2019.
   - The gap between actual spending and the 2016-2019 trend exceeds 13%, showing only slight improvement from the peak decline in January-February 2023.

3. **Graph Observations**:
   - From 2015 to early 2020, actual spending (blue line) follows an upward trend.
   - Post early 2020, there is a sharp decline correlating with the onset of the pandemic.
   - Post-mid-2021, the actual spending line flattens, indicating stagnation.

4. **Data Sources**:
   - The data is sourced from the China National Bureau of Statistics and includes calculations by Matthew Klein.

This summary highlights the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Chinese consumer spending, the persistence of lower spending levels, and the existing gap between actual and expected spending trends.
