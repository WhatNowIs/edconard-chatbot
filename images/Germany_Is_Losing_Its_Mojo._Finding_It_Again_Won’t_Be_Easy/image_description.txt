The chart titled "Faltering Factories" indicates trends in manufacturing output in Germany and the U.S. from roughly 2010 to 2023. Here's a summary of the information:

- Title: Faltering Factories
  - Subtitle: Germanyâ€™s factories surged ahead after the global financial crisis but have stalled since 2018.

- Germany's manufacturing output increased significantly after the global financial crisis, exceeding the U.S. output.
- However, since 2018, Germany's manufacturing growth has stalled.
- The graph uses 2015 as a baseline index (2015=100) for comparison.
  - The manufacturing output for Germany (orange line) surged above the U.S. (blue line) around 2018 but showed a noticeable decline afterward.
  - Both countries experienced a sharp drop around 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the recovery patterns differ.
  
- Data Source: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

Overall, the chart highlights a significant post-crisis growth in German manufacturing, followed by a stagnation and decline, with a marked dip around 2020, which aligns with global events such as the pandemic. The U.S. manufacturing output exhibits a more stable trend over the same period.
