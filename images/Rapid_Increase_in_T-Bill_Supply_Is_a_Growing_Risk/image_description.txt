The chart displays the share of Treasury bills (T-bills) as a percentage of the total marketable debt from January 2005 to mid-2023. Here are the key points:

1. **Early Observation (2005-2007)**:
   - The share of T-bills fluctuated around 20-25%.

2. **Financial Crisis of 2008**:
   - There is a significant increase in the T-bill share, peaking at around 35% during the financial crisis period (2008-2009).

3. **Post-Crisis Decline (2009-2015)**:
   - After the peak in 2009, there is a noticeable decline in the share of T-bills, reaching below 15% by 2015.

4. **Slow Recovery (2016-2019)**:
   - From 2015 onwards, the T-bill share shows a gradual increase, fluctuating around 15-20% up to 2019.

5. **Impact of COVID-19 (2020)**:
   - There is a sharp rise in the share during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, peaking again around 25%.

6. **Recent Trends (Post-2020)**:
   - Following the COVID-19 peak, the share decreases but starts to rise again from 2022 onwards, stabilizing around 20-25% in 2023.

**Summary**:
The share of Treasury bills has shown significant fluctuations over the past two decades. Major spikes were observed during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. After periods of decline, the T-bill share has seen a recent increase, reaching around 20-25% by mid-2023. This suggests that during times of economic uncertainty, the share of T-bills in total marketable debt tends to increase, potentially due to the governmentâ€™s short-term borrowing needs.
