The graph titled "Figure 7. Capital Income versus Wealth Taxation" compares the average tax rate under wealth tax and income tax as a function of the rate of return.

**Key Points:**
- The y-axis represents the average tax rate, ranging from 0% to 100%.
- The x-axis represents the rate of return, ranging from 0% to 20%.
- The wealth tax is depicted as a blue solid line, and the income tax is shown as a red dashed line.
- The income tax rate is fixed at 25%.
- The wealth tax rate is fixed at 1.25%, and its average tax rate decreases as the rate of return increases.

**Observations:**
- At very low rates of return (close to 0%), the average tax rate under the wealth tax is extremely high.
- As the rate of return increases, the average tax rate under the wealth tax significantly decreases and approaches a lower level.
- The average tax rate under the income tax remains constant at 25%, irrespective of the rate of return.
- The wealth tax starts to be lower than the income tax when the rate of return is above approximately 5%.

**Conclusion:**
The graph illustrates that for low rates of return, taxpayers are subject to a much higher average tax rate under a wealth tax compared to an income tax. However, as the rate of return increases, the wealth tax becomes more favorable, resulting in a lower average tax rate than the income tax for higher returns. The assumed rates for calculations are a capital income tax rate of 25% and a wealth tax rate of 1.25%.
