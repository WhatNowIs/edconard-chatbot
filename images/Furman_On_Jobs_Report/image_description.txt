   - A noticeable rise peaked around the middle of 2021, reaching close to or above 7%.
   - Post this period, a gradual downward trend is evident, particularly in the first half of 2022 with some modest recoveries towards the latter part of 2022.

4. **Note**: The data is adjusted for changing composition of employment using chain-weighted aggregation of average hourly earnings by industry sector, ensuring an accurate representation.

In summary, the graph indicates a dynamic landscape in average hourly earnings across private industries over the observed period, with noticeable peaks in the changes occurring intermittently. A general upward trend from early 2021 to mid-2021 slows down but revitalizes slightly towards the end of 2022. This reflects the economic adjustments and fluctuations in the labor market during these periods.
