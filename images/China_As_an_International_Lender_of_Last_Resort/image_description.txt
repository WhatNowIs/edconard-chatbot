The image is a global map illustrating countries that have received financial rescue assistance from China. The countries marked in red indicate those that have acquired such aid. This assistance is either through drawdowns on their RMB (Renminbi) swap lines or by receiving balance of payment support from Chinese state-owned banks and enterprises. It's important to note that swap drawings by non-distressed countries are not included in the map. 

Key takeaways:
- The map shows a wide geographical distribution of China's bilateral bailouts, spanning multiple continents including Asia, Europe, Africa, and South America.
- The specifics of the bailout involve either RMB swap lines or balance of payment support from Chinese institutions.
- The note emphasizes the exclusion of non-distressed countries from the depicted data.
