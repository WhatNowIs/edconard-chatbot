This figure illustrates the predicted probability of reemployment within 12 months, plotted against market size, which is measured by the number of workers. The plot compares two education levels: High School (blue line) and College (red line).

Key points are:

1. **Higher Education Increases Reemployment Probability**:
   - The probability of finding a job within 12 months is consistently higher for college graduates compared to high school graduates across all market sizes.

2. **Market Size Influence**:
   - For both education levels, as the market size increases, the probability of reemployment also increases but at different rates.
   - College workers start with a higher probability of reemployment and the gap between the two education levels widens as market size increases.

3. **Percentiles**:
   - The three vertical dashed lines represent the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the market size distribution.
   - At the 25th percentile (≈ 20,510 workers), both education levels show a considerable rise in reemployment probability from smaller market sizes.

4. **Maximum and Minimum Probabilities**:
   - The probability for high school workers ranges from about 0.74 to just above 0.8.
   - For college workers, it starts just below 0.8 and progresses towards 0.87-0.88 as market size increases.

5. **Prediction Calculation**:
   - The predicted values are derived using coefficients from a preferred specification outlined in Table 2, columns 5 and 6 of the referenced analysis.
   - The Y-axis has been rescaled to align the probabilities for an average-sized market (≈ 20,510 workers) with the unconditional reemployment probabilities observed in the data.

In summary, the graph indicates that an individual's education level and the size of the labor market are significant factors in determining the likelihood of reemployment within a year, with college education providing a distinct advantage.
