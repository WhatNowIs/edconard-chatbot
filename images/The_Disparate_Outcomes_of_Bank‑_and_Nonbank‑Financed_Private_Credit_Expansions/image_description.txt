The image presents a line graph analyzing the relationship between credit growth and the probability of extreme negative growth outcomes in real GDP over specified horizons in years. The key findings can be summarized as follows:

### Title:
- **Expansions in Nonbank Credit Predict a Lower Probability of Extreme Negative Growth Outcomes at the Two-to-Three-Year Horizon**

### Variables:
- **Δt-3,t bank credit (blue line)**: Represents the estimated coefficients for bank credit growth.
- **Δt-3,t nonbank credit (brown line)**: Represents the estimated coefficients for nonbank credit growth.

### Key Observations:
1. **Time Horizons**:
   - The graph spans a horizon of 1 to 5 years, tracking the effect over this period.

2. **Initial Impact**:
   - At the start of the observation, nonbank credit shows an initially lower probability of extreme negative growth (around -0.05) compared to bank credit which is closer to zero.

3. **Mid-term Observation (2-3 years)**:
   - Nonbank credit retains a more favorable outlook, predicting a lower probability of extreme negative growth outcomes around the 2-3 year mark.
   - Bank credit remains relatively stable but doesn't provide the same level of risk mitigation as nonbank credit.

4. **Long-term Trends (4-5 years)**:
   - Over time, the estimated effect of nonbank credit diminishes approaching zero, similar to bank credit towards the 5-year mark.

### Confidence Interval:
- **Dashed Lines**:
  - Represent the 10 percent confidence interval, indicating statistical uncertainty around the point estimates. 

### Sources and Notes:
- **Sources**:
  - Bank for International Settlements, International Monetary Fund, and authors' calculations.

- **Notes**:
  - The estimates are derived from a complementary log-log regression predicting the probability of future year-over-year real GDP growth falling below -2 percent based on three-year growth in bank and nonbank credit.
  - Standard errors are clustered at the country level.

### Summary:
The expansion of nonbank credit is associated with a reduced probability of extreme negative GDP growth outcomes, especially prominent in the 2-to-3-year horizon, compared to bank credit. This suggests a stabilizing effect of nonbank credit during this period, dropping near zero similarity to bank credit at longer horizons.
