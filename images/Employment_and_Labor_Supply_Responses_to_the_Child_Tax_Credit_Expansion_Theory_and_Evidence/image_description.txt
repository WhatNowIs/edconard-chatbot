The table presents the employment effects of Child Tax Credit (CTC) payments and the differential impacts for parents of young children, based on data from monthly CPS data, excluding July, from April to December 2021. The dependent variable used is whether an individual was employed in the previous week. The sample includes individuals aged 20-50.

### Key Findings:
1. **Households with Children aged ≤ 17:**
   - For the entire sample, having children aged ≤ 17 increases the likelihood of employment by 3.5% (significant at the 1% level, coefficient 0.035***).
   - The interaction term for post-July 2021 indicates a slight decrease, but it is not statistically significant.

2. **Households with Children aged ≤ 5:**
   - The presence of children ≤ 5 decreases the employment likelihood significantly. For the entire sample, this is a 5% decrease (coefficient -0.050***).
   - This effect remains significant and negative across different subgroups, such as females only, those with some college education or less, and unmarried females with some college education or less.
   - The interaction term for post-July 2021 shows a non-significant slight decrease for the entire sample but becomes significant and negative for the subgroup of "Some colleges & female & unmarried" (coefficient -0.045**).

### Subgroup Analysis:
1. **Females Only:**
   - The effect of children ≤ 17 on employment is not significant.
   - The effect of children ≤ 5 is a significant decrease in employment by 9.8% (coefficient -0.098***).

2. **Some College or Less & Female:**
   - Similar to the main sample, the presence of children ≤ 17 is not significantly different.
   - The effect of children ≤ 5 is a significant decrease in employment by 13.2% (coefficient -0.132***).

3. **Some College & Female & Unmarried:**
   - Similar to the main sample, the presence of children ≤ 17 increases employment significantly by 3.6% (coefficient 0.036***).
   - The effect of children ≤ 5 is a decrease in employment by 10.2% (coefficient -0.102***), which is significant.

### Statistical Significance:
- Asterisks indicate the level of statistical significance: 
  - *** p < 0.01
  - ** p < 0.05
  - * p < 0.1

### Joint Treatment Test:
- The p-values for the joint test of treatment effects indicate no strong rejection of null hypothesis except for the subgroup "Some College & Female & Unmarried" where p-value is 0.030.

### Pretreatment Mean:
- The pretreatment mean of households with children varies, with the highest being 0.769 for the entire sample and the lowest 0.597 for "Some college or less & female."

### Observations:
- Observations range across groups, with a maximum of 318,293 for the entire sample and a minimum of 53,160 for the subgroup "Some College & Female & Unmarried."

Overall, the data indicate that while CTC payments do not significantly alter employment probabilities post-July 2021 for the most part, the presence of younger children (≤ 5) tends to reduce employment likelihood significantly, particularly for females and unmarried women with some college education or less.
