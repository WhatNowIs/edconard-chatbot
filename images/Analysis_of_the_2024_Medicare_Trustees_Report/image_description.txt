The image is a graph titled "Fig. 1: Medicare Hospital Insurance Spending and Revenue (Percent of Taxable Payroll)." The graph presents three lines:

1. **Scheduled Costs (Red Line)**: Projected to continuously rise over time, peaking around 2045 and then slightly decreasing but remaining above the revenue line through 2095.
  
2. **Revenue (Blue Line)**: Shows a steady increase initially, then stabilizes, and slightly decreases mid-century before increasing again, consistently lower than the scheduled costs.

3. **Payable Costs (Green Line)**: Initially follows the scheduled costs, but starts to separate around 2036, noticeably diverging downwards after 2045. This line reflects the actual costs payable given the revenue constraints.

An important milestone noted on the graph:
- **HI Insolvency Date: 2036**: Indicating when Medicare Hospital Insurance is projected to become insolvent.
- **Percent Cut: 11%**: Represents the percentage cut in spending necessitated by insolvency.

The source of the data is Medicare Trustees.

### Summary:
The graph illustrates projected increases in Medicare Hospital Insurance costs compared to revenue from 2005 to 2095. Costs are expected to exceed revenue, with insolvency projected by 2036, necessitating an 11% spending cut. This shortfall highlights future financial challenges for Medicare, underscoring the need for policy adjustments to mitigate projected deficits.
