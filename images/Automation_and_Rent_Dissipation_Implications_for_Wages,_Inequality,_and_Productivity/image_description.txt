Figure 8 illustrates the effects of automation on wage changes between different educational groups from 1980 to 2016. It consists of five panels:

1. **A. Productivity effect**,
2. **B. Adds sectoral shifts**,
3. **C. Adds task displacement**,
4. **D. Adds ripples**, and
5. **E. Adds rent dissipation**.

Each panel plots the change in hourly wages against the hourly wage in 1980, indicating the impact of various factors due to automation on different educational groups, labeled as:
- Postgraduate
- College
- Some college
- Highschool
- Highschool dropout.

The horizontal axis in each panel represents the group's hourly wage in 1980, while the vertical axis represents the change in hourly wages from 1980 to 2016. The color-coding differentiates the educational groups, allowing a visual comparison of the wage effects across different levels of education.
