The graph from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) illustrates the year-over-year percent change in two indicators: the market yield on U.S. Treasury securities at a 5-year constant maturity (blue line), and the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) chain-type price index (red line), spanning from 2013 to 2023.

Key Points:
1. **Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities (5-Year)**:
   - Remained near or slightly below the zero percent change line until the end of 2021.
   - Experienced a noticeable upward trend starting in early 2022 and continues to show elevation through 2023, indicated by the highlighted area.

2. **Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index**:
   - Generally remained stable and around 1-2% change until 2020.
   - There was a sharp increase starting in early 2021, peaking at over 6% year-over-year change around mid-2022, followed by a decline towards the end of 2022.

3. **Recession Indication**:
   - The shaded areas highlight periods of U.S. recessions, including a specific downturn around early 2020 (coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic).

Summary:
The plot highlights that real rates, reflected by the yield on 5-year U.S. Treasury securities, have remained elevated despite a recent decline in inflation, as measured by the PCE price index. After a significant spike in inflation through 2021 and part of 2022, it has been steadily declining, whereas real rates have continued to increase, particularly from 2022 onwards. This situation suggests a tightening monetary policy stance by the Federal Reserve to address inflationary pressures.
