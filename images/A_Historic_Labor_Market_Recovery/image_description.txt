The image presents a graph titled "America's Great Employment Failure" which compares the employment rates of people in their prime working age (25-54 years) across several developed countries: USA, Japan, Germany, Canada, United Kingdom, and Australia. The data spans from the late 1990s to around 2022 and is sourced from OECD data, compiled by Joseph Politano.

Key points include:

1. **US Employment Rates Lagging**: The focus of the graph is to highlight that the United States' employment-population ratio for prime-age workers has consistently been lower than that of its peer nations, particularly noticeable since the mid-2000s.

2. **Effect of 2008 Financial Crisis**: All countries witnessed a dip in employment ratios around 2008-2009, corresponding with the global financial crisis. However, countries recovered at different rates.

3. **COVID-19 Impact**: There is a sharp drop in employment ratios across all countries around 2020, attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the recovery rates post-pandemic vary. The USA, represented by the yellow line, shows a notable dip during COVID-19 but also a rapid recovery afterward.

4. **Comparative Performance**:
   - **Germany (green line)** and **Japan (red line)** generally maintain higher employment ratios compared to the other countries.
   - **Canada (purple line)** also sees an overall upward trend in employment ratio over the years.
   - **United Kingdom (blue line)** and **Australia (dark blue line)** display fluctuations but generally maintain employment rates higher than the USA.

5. **Overall Employment Ratios**: By the end of the graph (2022), the USA's employment ratio for prime-age workers is still lagging behind most other countries, underlining the "employment failure" referenced in the title.

In summary, the graph underscores the persistent underperformance of the US employment-population ratio for prime-aged workers compared to several peer nations, despite periods of recovery and growth. This indicates systemic issues within the US labor market that have persisted across economic cycles and crises.
