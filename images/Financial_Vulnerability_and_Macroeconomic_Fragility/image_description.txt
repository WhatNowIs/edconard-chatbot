The image presents a comparative analysis of the effects of an interest rate shock during financially vulnerable and nonvulnerable (tranquil) periods. The analysis is divided into two key indicators:

1. **Financial Stability Rate Gap (\(r_t^{**} - r_t\))**:
   - The left graph shows the financial stability rate gap in percent over different quarters.
   - In tranquil periods (indicated by the blue solid line), the rate gap remains positive, initially around 1.4%, and shows a declining trend before stabilizing around 0.75% after 25 quarters.
   - In vulnerable periods (indicated by the red dashed line), the rate gap starts around 0.5%, drops to -0.5% at the shock point (quarter 0), and then gradually rises to stabilize around 0.5% after 25 quarters.

2. **GDP (\(Y_t\))**:
   - The right graph depicts the percent deviation of GDP from a no-shock path over different quarters.
   - In tranquil periods (blue solid line), the deviation is minimal and slightly negative, stabilizing close to zero after 25 quarters.
   - In vulnerable periods (red dashed line), the GDP experiences a significant drop of nearly -5% at the shock point (quarter 0), recovers partially to -1% by the 5th quarter, and then slowly converges towards zero by the 25th quarter.

Overall, the graphs highlight the stark difference in the impact of an interest rate shock during financially tranquil versus vulnerable periods, with vulnerable periods showing more pronounced negative effects on financial stability and GDP.
