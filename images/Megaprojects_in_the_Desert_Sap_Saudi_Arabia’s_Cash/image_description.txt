The image presents a bar chart titled "Borrowing Big" that illustrates the annual issuance of U.S. dollar bonds by three entities in Saudi Arabia: the Saudi Arabian government (represented in dark gold), the Public Investment Fund (PIF, represented in light gold), and Saudi Aramco (represented in pale gold). The time period covered spans from 2010 to 2024, with the 2024 data collected up until February 14.

Key highlights:
1. From 2010 to around 2016, there was limited issuance of U.S. dollar bonds by these entities, with notable increases starting post-2015.
2. Post-2015, the issuance increased significantly, especially by the Saudi Arabian government, with marked spikes around 2017 and 2018.
3. Saudi Aramco began issuing bonds around 2019, contributing substantially in multiple years afterward.
4. In 2022 and 2023, the data shows substantial borrowing by all three entities, with a significant increase in 2023.
5. The most recent data for 2024, up to February 14, already shows substantial bond issuance, indicating that the trend may continue.

The source of the data is Dealogic, and it provides a clear picture of how Saudi entities have been increasingly participating in U.S. dollar bond markets over the years.
