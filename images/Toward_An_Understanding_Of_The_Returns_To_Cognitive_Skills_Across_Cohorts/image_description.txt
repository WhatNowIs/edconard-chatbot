This image displays Figure 2, which comprises an adjusted distribution of the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) scores for White Non-Hispanic Men from two different cohorts: NLSY-79 and NLSY-97. 

Key points and summary:

- **AFQT Score Range**: The scores range from 75 to 225.
- **Density Curves**: The distribution is depicted with two density curves:
  - The NLSY-79 cohort is represented by a dashed green line.
  - The NLSY-97 cohort is represented by a solid red line.
  
The summary statistics for both cohorts are provided:

1. **NLSY-79 (Green Dashed Line)**
   - Mean AFQT: 172.7
   - Standard Deviation (SD): 29.0
   - Skewness: -0.62
   - Percentile Scores: 
     - 1st percentile (p1): 104
     - 5th percentile (p5): 118
     - 10th percentile (p10): 130
     - 50th percentile (p50): 178

2. **NLSY-97 (Red Solid Line)**
   - Mean AFQT: 173.4
   - Standard Deviation (SD): 29.8
   - Skewness: -0.81
   - Percentile Scores: 
     - 1st percentile (p1): 94
     - 5th percentile (p5): 113
     - 10th percentile (p10): 129
     - 50th percentile (p50): 179

In summary, the figure presents a comparison of the AFQT score distributions between two different cohorts of White Non-Hispanic Men, showing slight variations in means, standard deviations, and a noticeable difference in skewness, with NLSY-97 being slightly more negatively skewed. Despite these differences, both distribution curves are quite similar in shape, indicating a relatively stable AFQT performance across these cohorts.
