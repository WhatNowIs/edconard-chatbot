The chart titled "Figure 1: The High-Yield Spread Over Time" documents the fluctuations in high-yield spread from 1964 to 2020. Key points of interest:

1. **Trends and Fluctuations**:
   - The high-yield spread, which represents the difference in yield between high-risk bonds and safer government bonds, has varied significantly over time.
   - Periods of elevated spreads are often followed by declines, reflecting economic cycles.

2. **Recessions**:
   - The gray bars indicate periods of economic recessions, as dated by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).
   - Spikes in the high-yield spread often correspond with these recessions, suggesting that economic downturns increase risk premiums.

3. **Recent Data**:
   - The dotted line marks the current level of spreads at the time of the chart's publication.
   - High-yield spreads have occasionally spiked dramatically, such as during the early 1980s, early 2000s, and the financial crisis of 2008-2009.

4. **Data Sources**:
   - Data from multiple sources were used: Fred BofA High Yield Spread since 1997, Bloomberg Barclays index from 1987 to 1997, and Verdad estimates from FRED data prior to 1987.

This chart is useful for analyzing the relationship between economic conditions and the risk premiums reflected in high-yield spreads, demonstrating that these spreads often widen significantly during economic downturns.
