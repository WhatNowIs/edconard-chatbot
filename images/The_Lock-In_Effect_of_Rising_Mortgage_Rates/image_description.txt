The image is a graph that illustrates the modeled cumulative effects on home prices due to increases in interest rates and lock-in since Q1 2022. The graph tracks these effects through to Q4 2023 and presents each impact:

1. **Lock-In Impact** (blue line):
   - Shows a positive cumulative effect on home prices.
   - By Q4 2023, the effect is estimated to be +5.7%, with a 95% confidence interval between +1.3% and +10.2%.

2. **Rate Impact** (red dashed line):
   - Shows a negative cumulative effect on home prices.
   - By Q4 2023, the effect is estimated to be -3.3%, with a 95% confidence interval between -6.7% and +0.1%.

3. **Total Impact** (green dotted line):
   - Combining both the lock-in and rate impacts results in a net positive effect on home prices.
   - By Q4 2023, the total effect is estimated to be +2.5%, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from -1.8% to +6.7%.

The shaded region and error bars represent the 95% confidence intervals for these estimates.

**Important Notes:**
- The chart uses calculations from NMDB and FHFA HPI data.
- The data reflects the author's calculations applied to modeled scenarios rather than actual past conditions.

In summary, the graph suggests that while increasing interest rates alone would have a negative effect on home prices, the lock-in effect could outweigh this, resulting in a modest overall positive impact on home prices by the end of 2023 when the total effects are combined.
