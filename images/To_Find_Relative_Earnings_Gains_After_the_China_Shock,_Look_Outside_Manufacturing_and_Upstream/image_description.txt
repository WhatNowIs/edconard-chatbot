**Source Information:**
- Data sources include LEHD (Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics), LBD (Longitudinal Business Database), and the authors' calculations.
- The analysis focuses on workers transitioning out of manufacturing across various 2-digit NAICS sectors.
- Some states like Alabama, Arkansas, New Hampshire, Mississippi, and the District of Columbia are excluded due to lack of information in LEHD for these years.
