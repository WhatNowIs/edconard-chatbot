The graph displays the global consumption of different energy sources from the year 2000 to 2022, measured in exajoules. The energy sources included in the graph are oil, coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, hydroelectricity, and renewables.

From the graph, we can summarize the following:

1. **Oil Consumption**: Oil remains the dominant energy source throughout the period, showing a consistent increase over the years, reaching around 600 exajoules in 2022.

2. **Coal Consumption**: Coal consumption also shows a steady increase, especially between 2000 and 2014, after which it fluctuates but remains a significant portion of the total energy consumption.

3. **Natural Gas Consumption**: Natural gas usage has grown steadily throughout the period and occupies a substantial share of the total energy consumption by 2022.

4. **Nuclear Energy**: The consumption of nuclear energy has remained relatively stable over the years, with slight fluctuations but no significant overall increase.

5. **Hydroelectricity**: The use of hydroelectric power has shown a moderate, steady increase over the years.

6. **Renewables**: Renewable energy sources have seen a significant growth, especially after 2010, and continue to increase rapidly, albeit starting from a lower base compared to other energy sources.

Overall, the demand for energy has increased over the years with oil, coal, and natural gas being the most consumed energy sources. However, there has been a notable rise in the use of renewable energy sources, reflecting a shift towards cleaner energy.
