The image presents a line graph analyzing the marginal mean probabilities of being pregnant or trying to conceive based on recent financial changes and remote work status. 

Key points from the graph:

1. **X-Axis**: Illustrates the recent financial changes categorized as "Much better," "Slightly better," "Slightly worse," and "Much worse."
2. **Y-Axis**: Represents the probabilities, ranging from 0% to 30%, of being pregnant or trying to conceive.
3. **Lines**: 
   - The gold line represents individuals who have some remote work.
   - The green line represents individuals who have no remote work.

Summary:

- Individuals experiencing improved financial situations ("Much better" to "Slightly better") generally have higher probabilities of being pregnant or trying, with a noticeable decrease as financial situations worsen ("Slightly worse" to "Much worse").
- Those with some remote work start with higher probabilities (around 28%) in much better financial situations, compared to those with no remote work (about 20%).
- As financial conditions worsen:
  - Both groups show a declining trend in the probabilities.
  - For those with some remote work, the probability decrease is less steep compared to those with no remote work.
- When the financial condition becomes much worse, both groups converge to similar lower probabilities of around 10%.

The data suggests that financial stability positively correlates with the likelihood of being pregnant or trying, and remote work slightly mitigates the negative impact of financial decline.
