This chart tracks the growth and composition of US portfolio holdings compared with China's reserves and other foreign assets over the span of Q1 2000 to Q1 2023 in USD billion. Key components include different asset classes such as deposits, short-term and long-term treasuries, Belgium holdings, long-term agencies, long-term corporate bonds, and US equities. 

### Key Observations:

1. **Overall Growth**:
   - From Q1 2000 to Q1 2014, there was a significant overall increase in the total value of these holdings, peaking around Q1 2014.
   - Post 2014, the holdings have shown fluctuations but generally stayed below the peak levels observed during Q1 2014.

2. **Asset Class Analysis**:
   - **Deposits** (grey part) and **Short-term Treasuries** (light green) remained relatively low and stable throughout the period.
   - **Long-term Treasuries** (light green) and **US Equities** (red) saw substantial growth, especially notable between Q1 2007 and Q1 2014.
   - **Belgium** holdings (dark green) had intermittent spikes, particularly noticeable around Q1 2014.
   - **Long-term Agencies** (light blue) and **Long-term Corporates** (dark blue) increased steadily but experienced declines post-2014 peak.

3. **Reserve Lines**:
   - The chart includes dashed lines marking 60% and 80% of the total reserves, illustrating a significant overlap with the growing asset values up to the 2014 peak and subsequent fluctuations.

### Summary:
The chart illustrates a rapid accumulation of a diversified portfolio of US assets by China over 14 years, reaching a significant height in early 2014, followed by a turbulent period with fluctuations and a general decline from those peak levels. The variety of asset classes indicates a strategic approach to reserve management, with notable emphasis on long-term treasuries and equities.
