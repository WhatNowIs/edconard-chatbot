The image is a line graph titled "Cumulative changes of aggregate markups in recoveries" (Figure 4). It shows the percent change in aggregate markups over 11 quarters since the end of four different recessions: 1991:Q2, 2002:Q1, 2009:Q3, and 2020:Q3. 

Key observations:

1. **1991:Q2 (Green Line)**:
   - Starts at 0% and rises gradually, maintaining an overall upward trend, peaking at around 2% by the 11th quarter.
   
2. **2002:Q1 (Yellow Line)**:
   - Begins at 0%, dips immediately to around -4% by the 5th quarter, and continues fluctuating slightly below 0% up to the 11th quarter.

3. **2009:Q3 (Light Blue Line)**:
   - Initially decreases to around -3% by the 4th quarter, recovers to nearly 1% by the 11th quarter.
   
4. **2020:Q3 (Dark Blue Line)**:
   - Decreases sharply to -2% initially, then fluctuates with an overall recovery peaking near 2% in later quarters.

The chart notes that the markups are based on intermediate inputs and are indexed to the beginning of the recovery. The source of the data is the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
