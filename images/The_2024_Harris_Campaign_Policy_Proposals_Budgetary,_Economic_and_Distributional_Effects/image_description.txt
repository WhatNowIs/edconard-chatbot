The table titled "Economic Effects of the Harris Campaign Policy Proposals" outlines projected percent changes from the baseline for several economic indicators over the years 2034, 2039, 2044, 2049, and 2054. The key findings are:

1. **Gross Domestic Product (GDP)**: Shows a steady decline, starting with -1.3% in 2034 and worsening to -3.9% by 2054.
2. **Capital Stock**: Experiences a significant decrease over time, from -2.4% in 2034 to -7.8% in 2054.
3. **Hours Worked**: Remains relatively stable with a slight decrease, oscillating around -0.7% over the years.
4. **Average Wage**: Declines progressively, beginning at -0.8% in 2034 and reaching -3.3% by 2054.
5. **Consumption**: Shows a decreasing trend, starting from -0.7% in 2034 and falling to -2.1% in 2054.
6. **Debt Held by the Public**: Increases over time, starting at 4.4% in 2034 and rising to 7.7% in 2054.

In summary, the policy proposals are projected to negatively impact most economic indicators, with declining GDP, capital stock, hours worked, average wage, and consumption, while significantly increasing public debt over time.
