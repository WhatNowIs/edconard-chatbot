The chart shows the trends in treasury holdings by commercial banks and the Federal Reserve in billions of dollars from September 2018 to March 2023. The blue line represents bank holdings (on the right-axis, RHS), while the orange line represents Fed holdings.

Here are the key takeaways:

1. Treasury holdings by commercial banks (blue line) have increased significantly from September 2019, peaking around mid-2022, and have slightly declined afterward.
2. Fed holdings (orange line) initially showed a slight increase until March 2020 before significantly rising due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, peaking around mid-2021, and then gradually declining.
3. The general trend shows that both the Federal Reserve and commercial banks were net buyers of Treasuries until their respective peaks, after which both have ceased to be net buyers of Treasuries.
4. The source of the data is the Federal Reserve, and bank holdings include some non-MBS (mortgage-backed securities) agencies.

The summarized insight is that Fed and commercial banks increased their treasury holdings significantly during the pandemic, but as of recent periods, they are no longer net buyers of Treasuries.
