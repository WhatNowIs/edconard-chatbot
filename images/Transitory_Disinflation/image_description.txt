The graph displays the standard deviations from the average value of a time series from September 30, 1997, to November 30, 2023. The blue line represents the historical data, while the yellow line likely represents more recent or projected values.

Here are key observations from the graph:

1. **Stable Periods**: From 1998 to around 2020, the standard deviations mostly fluctuate within a range of approximately -2 to 2. There were minor fluctuations with occasional peaks and troughs but overall maintained stability around the mean (0 standard deviations).

2. **Significant Increase**: After 2020, there is a noticeable significant increase in standard deviations, reaching a peak value of around 5 standard deviations from the average. This suggests a considerable deviation from the historical norms around this period.

3. **Recent Trends**: Post the peak (likely around mid-2022), the deviations show a sharp decline back towards the mean, indicating a return to more typical values. The yellow segment towards the end suggests a rapid correction back to values slightly above and below the mean.

In summary, the time series data remained relatively stable over the years with normal fluctuations until around 2020. Post-2020, there was a significant deviation that peaked around mid-2022, followed by a quick reversion back towards the average by late 2023.
