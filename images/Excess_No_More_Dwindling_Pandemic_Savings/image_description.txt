The image, titled "Figure 1: Aggregate personal savings versus the pre-pandemic trend," illustrates the changes in personal savings from 2016 to 2023. 

### Key Insights:
1. **Pre-Pandemic Trend**: The blue dotted line represents the pre-pandemic trend in personal savings.
2. **Personal Savings**: The solid blue line shows the actual personal savings over time.
3. **Accumulated Excess Savings**: Indicated by the green shaded area, represents a total of $2.1 trillion accumulated during the pandemic period.
4. **Drawdowns of Excess Savings**: The red shaded area shows a drawdown of $1.9 trillion in excess savings post-pandemic.

### Observations:
- **Pandemic Impact**: A significant increase in personal savings is noticeable during the early months of 2020, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This increase peaks several times throughout the year.
- **Post-Pandemic Trend**: Savings began to deplete after the peak periods, with a notable drawdown observed in subsequent years, especially post-2022, approaching pre-pandemic levels by 2023.

Data for the analysis is derived from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and authors' calculations, using excess savings calculated as the accumulated difference in actual de-annualized personal savings and the trend implied by data from the 48 months leading up to the 2020 recession as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).
