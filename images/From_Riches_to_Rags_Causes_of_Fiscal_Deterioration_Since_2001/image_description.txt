The chart titled "Effect of Tax Cuts, Spending Increases, and Stimulus Enacted Since 2001 on Debt (% of GDP)" illustrates the growing impact of various economic policies on the U.S. national debt as a percentage of GDP from 2001 through 2023. 

Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

1. **Underlying Debt**: Initially, the underlying debt-to-GDP started at about 30% in 2001 and steadily increased over the years, reflecting baseline debt trends.

2. **Recession Responses**: This component highlights the additional debt incurred due to recession responses, which peaked between 2008 and 2011 during the Great Recession and again in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching around 28% of GDP.

3. **Major Tax Cuts**: Another significant contributor to the debt is major tax cuts enacted over the years. This category shows an increasing trend, particularly noticeable from 2003 onwards, contributing to about 37% of GDP by 2023.

4. **Discretionary Spending Increases**: This category began to noticeably impact the GDP around 2008, continuously rising and contributing approximately 33% to the debt-to-GDP percentage by 2023.

5. **Medicare Expansions**: Representing the additional debt incurred from Medicare expansions, this begins to become significant around 2010 and continues to grow, adding up to around 33% of GDP by 2023.

Overall, the chart visually communicates how tax cuts, discretionary spending increases, recession responses, and Medicare expansions have compounded over time, leading to a significant rise in national debt relative to GDP. According to the sources, the Congressional Budget Office and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, these figures take into account policy changes since 2001 and exclude automatic growth in Social Security and Medicare.
