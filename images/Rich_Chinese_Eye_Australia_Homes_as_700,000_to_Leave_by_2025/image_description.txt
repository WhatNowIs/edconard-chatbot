The image highlights the projected migration of 712,000 Chinese nationals to the US, Canada, and Australia by 2025. Here are the key details:

- The projections span three years: 2023, 2024, and 2025.
- Migration figures are depicted with bars representing the three destination countries:
  - Canada (black)
  - Australia (pink)
  - The US (yellow)

**Projection for 2023:**
- A significant number of Chinese migrants are expected to move to the US, exceeding the numbers to Canada and Australia.

**Projection for 2024:**
- Again, the US is the primary destination, with slightly fewer migrants compared to 2023. Canada and Australia also maintain a significant share.

**Projection for 2025:**
- The trend continues, with the US being the top destination, though with slightly fewer migrants than in 2024. Meanwhile, Canada and Australia remain consistent in their shares.

Note: The projections are based on the actual share of total migration in recent years, according to Juwai IQI.
