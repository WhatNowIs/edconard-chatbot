The image presents Figure 3, which shows the differences between treatment and control counties over time across three different metrics: population, manufacturing production employment, and median family income. Each metric is displayed in a separate panel with the following details:

### Panel A: Log Population
- This panel shows the log population differences between treatment and control counties from 1900 to 2000.
- Four covariate specifications are plotted:
  - **Baseline** (red)
  - **+ Geography/Infrastructure** (blue)
  - **All Covariates** (green)
  - **All Covariates: Smaller Plant** (grey)
- Two significant vertical lines around the early 1940s and mid-1970s are notable, likely indicating policy changes or significant events affecting population.

### Panel B: Log Manufacturing Production Employment (Log Mfg Production Employment)
- This panel illustrates the log differences in manufacturing production employment over the same period.
- The same four covariate specifications are used as in Panel A.
- There is a notable spike in differences around the early 1940s, reflecting possible industrial changes or wartime production shifts.

### Panel C: Log Median Family Income
- This panel depicts the log differences in median family income from 1940 to 2000.
- The specifications remain consistent with the previous panels.
- Median family income shows fluctuating patterns with significant movements during the same early 1940s period.

### Summary
The figure highlights the longitudinal differences in log population, manufacturing production employment, and median family income between treatment and control counties. Notable events or policy implementations around the early 1940s and mid-1970s are marked by vertical red lines across all panels, affecting all three metrics. The effects of different covariate specifications are compared, indicating variations in the trends depending on the factors included in the analysis.
