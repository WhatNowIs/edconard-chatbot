The chart titled "A Big Shift in Traffic Risk by Race" illustrates motor vehicle deaths per 100,000 population from 1979 to around 2020, segmented by racial groups: White, Black or African American, White only, and Black or African American only. Hereâ€™s a summary of the information:

1. **Early Trends (1979-2000s):**
   - **White individuals (blue line)**: Initially, the motor vehicle death rate for Whites was higher but saw a consistent decrease over time.
   - **Black or African American individuals (black line)**: The death rate remained relatively stable but started to show a decline aligning closely with the rate for Whites by the mid-2000s.

2. **Recent Trends (2000s-2020):**
   - Both groups experienced a decrease in motor vehicle death rates, remaining very close to each other, up until the early 2020s.
   - A significant increase in the death rate for Black or African American individuals (black and red lines) is observed from around 2015-2020, noticeably outpacing the rate for Whites.

3. **Current Data:**
   - As of the latest data, the motor vehicle death rate for Black or African American individuals has sharply risen to approximately 18 per 100,000 population.
   - For Whites, the rate has risen slightly but remains lower than that for Black or African American individuals, around 12 per 100,000 population.

4. **Additional Notes:**
   - The data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not include individuals identified as multiracial.

This chart highlights a significant shift in traffic risk over the decades, with most recent years showing an alarming increase in motor vehicle deaths particularly affecting the Black or African American population.
