The figure presents a plot titled "Figure 4: Response of GDP Price Index Inflation to a Disinflationary Shock, b. Using Scaled Dummy (evaluated at commitment levels of 1 and 5)." It shows the effect of a disinflationary shock on GDP price index inflation over 20 quarters. 

Key observations:
- The y-axis indicates the percent change in GDP price index inflation, ranging from -4% to 3%.
- The x-axis represents time in quarters after the shock, up to 20 quarters.
- Two scenarios are evaluated: "Scaled (evaluated at level 1)" and "Scaled (evaluated at level 5)."
   - For level 1, the impact is minimal, hovering slightly below and around 0% after the initial shock.
   - For level 5, the impact is more pronounced, showing a steep decline, reaching about -3% around the 6th quarter and then fluctuating but maintaining a negative trend just below -2%.

Summary:
The graph illustrates the differential impact on GDP price index inflation of a disinflationary shock under two commitment levels. At commitment level 1, the inflation rate remains relatively stable, whereas at commitment level 5, the inflation rate experiences a significant drop, highlights accentuated disinflation over time.
