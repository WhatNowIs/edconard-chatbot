The provided chart illustrates the projected growth in China's energy storage capacity from 2022 to 2030. Key details from the chart are summarized below:

1. **2022 Data**:
   - **Pumped hydro by grid companies**: There is a significant portion dedicated to this type of energy storage.
   - **Pumped hydro by non-grid**: A much smaller section compared to grid companies.
   - **New storage types (mainly batteries)**: Minor inclusion in 2022.

2. **2030 Estimate**:
   - **Pumped hydro by grid companies**: Considerable growth compared to 2022, but relatively small in comparison to the total projected capacity.
   - **Pumped hydro by non-grid**: Slight increase over 2022.
   - **New storage types (mainly batteries)**: This sees an exponential increase, dominating the projected energy storage landscape by 2030.

3. **Overall Trend**:
   - China's energy storage capacity is expected to grow 70-fold over the next decade.
   - The predominant growth is anticipated in new storage types, mainly batteries, which will form the bulk of China's energy storage by 2030.
