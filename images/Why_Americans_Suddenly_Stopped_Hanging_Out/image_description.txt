The chart titled "Percent of Teens Who Say They Go out With Friends Two-Plus Times a Week" shows a trend over time for 12th graders from 1976 to 2020, separating the data into boys (represented by a blue line) and girls (represented by a red line). The data was gathered from "Monitoring the Future" and analyzed by Jean M. Twenge.

Key points from the chart:

- In 1976, approximately 85% of boys and 80% of girls reported going out with friends two-plus times a week.
- Over the years, both percentages fluctuated but generally remained within the range of 70% to 85% until around 2008.
- Post-2008, there was a notable decline for both genders.
- By 2020, the percentage of boys had dropped to approximately 55%, and the percentage of girls had also decreased significantly, hitting a low of around 45% before showing a slight uptick.

Overall, the chart indicates a substantial decrease over the last four decades in the number of teens who report going out with friends two or more times a week, with a more pronounced decline after 2008.
