The image provides a comparative analysis of voting trends in the UK and the US, particularly focusing on the conservative/Republican voting patterns across different generations as they age. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key observations:

1. **Generational Voting Trends**:
   - **Boomers and Silent Generation**: Both in the UK and the US, these generations tend to vote increasingly conservative (UK) or Republican (US) as they age.
   - **Gen X** (UK and US): This generation shows a slight tendency to move towards conservative/Republican as they age, though the trend is less pronounced compared to the Boomer and Silent generations.
   
2. **Millennials**:
   - **UK**: Millennial voters in the UK display a notable deviation from the expected pattern; instead of growing more conservative as they age, they are becoming less conservative compared to the national average.
   - **US**: Similarly, Millennials in the US are not following the common trend of becoming more Republican with age. Instead, their Republican vote share is either flat or declining over time.

3. **Position Relative to National Average**:
   - **UK**: The data suggests that, unlike previous generations, Millennials fall below the national average in terms of conservative vote share and continue to diverge further as they age.
   - **US**: Millennial voting patterns also show a consistent deviation below the national average in Republican vote share, contrasting with older generations who see an increase above the national average over time.

4. **Data Sources and Presentation**:
   - Sources for the data include the British Election Study, US General Social Survey, American National Election Studies, and Cooperative Election Study.
   - This analysis is visually represented with distinct color-coded lines for each generation, highlighting the trends relative to the national average over the age spectrum.

Overall, the central finding is that Millennial voters in both the UK and the US are not adhering to the historical trend of becoming more conservative or Republican with age, marking a significant generational shift in political behavior.
