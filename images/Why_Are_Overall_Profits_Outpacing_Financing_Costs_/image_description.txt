The image is a graph titled "Figure 4: Estimated rise in capital returns for private companies," depicting the returns over a period from around 1950 to 2020. 

The graph shows two lines indicating the estimated capital returns for privately held companies (in blue) and publicly traded companies (in green). The key points are as follows:

1. **Privately Held Companies**:
   - The returns have generally been higher than those of publicly traded companies throughout the period.
   - The capital returns show fluctuations, with noticeable peaks around the late 1980s and mid-2000s.

2. **Publicly Traded Companies**:
   - The returns have been relatively stable but lower compared to privately held companies.
   - There is a noticeable dip around the early 2000s.

Overall, the graph suggests that privately held companies have had higher and more variable capital returns compared to publicly traded companies over the given period.
