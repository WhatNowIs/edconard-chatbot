The image consists of three graphs, each displaying data related to services decomposed (year-on-year), annualized on a 3-month moving average and 1-month moving average basis. The graphs represent different categories of services, including Travel-related, Medical services, Housing, Services, and Other.

**Key Observations:**

1. **Services Decomposed (YoY%):**
   - This graph shows the year-over-year percentage change in various service categories from 1Q19 to 2Q25E.
   - There is an upward trend starting from mid-2020, peaking in 2021/2022, with Services (in black) showing the highest upward movement followed by a slight decline into 2023/2024.
   - Travel-related services (in blue), Housing (in red), and Other (in purple) also show significant increases during the same period.
   - Medical services (in indigo) exhibit relatively stable growth over the same period.

2. **3 Months Annualized:**
   - This graph illustrates the 3-month annualized percentage change in the mentioned service categories across the same timeframe.
   - A clearer fluctuation pattern is observable, with significant peaks around mid-2021 and mid-2022.
   - Services experienced the highest peaks around these times but then saw a decrease toward late 2023 and 2024.
   - Travel-related services show volatile movements with significant peaks and troughs.
   - Housing and Other services also exhibit upward and downward movements but remain more stable compared to Travel-related services.
   - Medical services have slight fluctuations but generally maintain positive growth.

3. **1 Month Annualized:**
   - This graph presents the 1-month annualized percentage change in the service categories.
   - Extremely volatile changes are visible, more so than in the 3-month annualized data.
   - Significant peaks correspond to rapid increases, particularly noticeable in Services, and considerable troughs indicate sharp declines.
   - Travel-related and Housing services show similar sharp fluctuations but less extreme than Services.
   - Other services remain more stable with slight increases and decreases.
   - Medical services continue showing minor but mostly positive fluctuations.

**Summary:**
From mid-2020 onwards, all services experienced marked increases in growth, particularly noticeable in 2021 and 2022. While Services, Travel-related, and Housing were the primary drivers of this growth, Medical services remained relatively stable. Both the 3-month and 1-month annualized data highlight the volatility, particularly in the Travel-related and Services sectors, with significant fluctuations indicating periods of rapid growth and decline. The data underscores the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of service-related growth in recent years.
