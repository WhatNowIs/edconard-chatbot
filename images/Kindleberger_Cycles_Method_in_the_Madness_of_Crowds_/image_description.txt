The image is a graph illustrating social and private returns to R&D (Research and Development) in the USA over time, from 1985 to 2015. The graph compares these returns to various benchmarks for the cost of capital with different levels of systematic risk.

Here is a summary of the key points:

1. **Social Return to R&D** (red line with a shaded confidence interval) shows that the social returns to aggregate R&D have fluctuated between approximately 60% and 85% over the years. 

2. **Private Return to R&D** (blue line with a shaded confidence interval) indicates that private returns to aggregate R&D generally remain around 20%.

3. **Cost of Capital Benchmarks**:
   - The **T bond yield** (dotted green line) serves as the baseline for the cost of capital.
   - **T bond yield + implied equity risk premium** (green dashed line) considers the market risk premium for typically risky ventures.
   - **T bond yield + 2× implied equity risk premium** (solid green line) reflects the cost of capital for high-risk ventures.
   - **T bond yield + 4× implied equity risk premium** (yellow dashed line) represents the extreme risk ventures.

4. The data points reveal that social returns to R&D are significantly higher than private returns and various benchmarks of the cost of capital. This suggests that R&D investments yield larger societal benefits compared to private benefits, indicating a strong argument for public support of R&D.

5. Data sources for the graph include research papers by Lucking, Bloom & Van Reenen (2019) and other studies, as described in the image caption.

Overall, the comparison shows that R&D investments have consistently higher social returns than private returns, aligning with the notion that R&D can generate significant public good and societal benefit beyond immediate private gains.
