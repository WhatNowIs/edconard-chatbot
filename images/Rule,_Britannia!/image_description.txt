The provided image illustrates the impact of Brexit on small cap firms by analyzing changes in margin spread (EBITDA and EBIT) and valuation spread (Price/Book) before and after Brexit. The key data points are as follows:

**Before Brexit (2018 - 2020):**
- EBITDA Margin Spread: 2.5 percentage points (pp)
- EBIT Margin Spread: 1.2 pp
- Price/Book Spread: 0.10x

**After Brexit (2021 - 2023):**
- EBITDA Margin Spread: 0.9 pp
- EBIT Margin Spread: 0.0 pp
- Price/Book Spread: -0.04x

**Brexit Effect:**
- EBITDA Margin Spread decreased by 65.3%
- EBIT Margin Spread decreased by 99.3%
- Price/Book Spread decreased by 141.3%

The data indicates significant reductions in both operational profitability margins (EBITDA and EBIT) and valuation ratios (Price/Book) for small cap firms in the period following Brexit. These firms are defined as those with a market cap above $25M and below approximately $2.5B, pointing to considerable financial and valuation impacts attributed to the Brexit period. The analysis uses data from S&P Capital IQ and Verdad analysis.
