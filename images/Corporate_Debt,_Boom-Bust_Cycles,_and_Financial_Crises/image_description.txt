The provided figure, titled "Figure 3: Decomposing Credit Growth Around Financial Crises," visually represents the changes in total credit-to-GDP ratio around the onset of systemic financial crises. The data is categorized into three sectors: Households (light blue), Non-financial corporations (purple), and Non-bank financial corporations (light purple).

Key observations from the figure:

1. **Time Frame Analyzed:** The x-axis represents years since the start of the crisis, ranging from -5 to +5.
2. **Credit Growth Trends:**
   - **Pre-crisis Period (-5 to 0 years):**
     - Credit to GDP grows steadily from 3% five years before the crisis to slightly over 5% one year before the crisis.
     - Non-financial corporations (purple) and households (light blue) experience significant credit growth before the crisis.
   - **Crisis Year (0 years):**
     - There's a sharp decline in credit growth during the crisis, dropping into negative territory just after the crisis starts.
   - **Post-crisis Period (0 to +5 years):**
     - Credit-to-GDP decreases immediately after the crisis, with non-financial corporations showing the most substantial reduction.
     - A mild recovery in total credit growth begins approximately 4-5 years post-crisis.

3. **Sector Contribution to Credit Growth:**
   - Prior to the crisis, both households and non-financial corporations contribute significantly to the rise in credit-to-GDP.
   - During and after the crisis, the drag on credit growth is predominantly from non-financial corporations.

**Notes:** The figure decomposes changes in credit-to-GDP across 87 crises (panel a) and 62 crises (panel b), and is based on studies by Baron et al. (2020) and Laeven and Valencia (2020).

Overall, the figure illustrates the cyclical nature of credit growth surrounding financial crises, highlighting the significant pre-crisis buildup and sharp post-crisis de-leveraging.
