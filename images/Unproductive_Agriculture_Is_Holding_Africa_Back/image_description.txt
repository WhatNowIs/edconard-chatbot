The provided image is a line graph titled "Change since 1961 in agricultural productivity, accounting for all inputs including land and labor." The baseline level of productivity in 1961 is set at 100.

### Key Information:

1. **Time Frame**: The graph covers the period from 1961 to around 2020.
2. **Geographical Focus**: 
   - World (represented by a dark line)
   - Sub-Saharan Africa (represented by a light line)
3. **Source**: U.S. Department of Agriculture
4. **Presentation**: Presented by The New York Times

### Summary:

The graph illustrates the change in agricultural productivity globally and in Sub-Saharan Africa since 1961. Both trends start at a productivity level of 100 in 1961.

- **World**: 
  - There has been a consistent and significant increase in global agricultural productivity from 1961 to 2020. 
  - By 2020, global productivity has increased to around 180, indicating a robust and continual upward trend.

- **Sub-Saharan Africa**: 
  - Productivity has shown a much slower increase compared to the global trend.
  - There are fluctuations over the years, but overall, the increase is modest.
  - By 2020, productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa is slightly above 120, suggesting it has lagged considerably behind the global productivity growth.

### Conclusion:

While global agricultural productivity has seen substantial improvements since 1961, the productivity increase in Sub-Saharan Africa has been much slower and less consistent. This highlights a significant disparity in agricultural advancements between the global average and the Sub-Saharan African region.
