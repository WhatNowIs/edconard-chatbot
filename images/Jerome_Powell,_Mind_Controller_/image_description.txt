Key Points:
1. **Time Range and Source**: The data spans from January 1986 to July 2023 and is provided by the National Federation of Independent Business.
2. **Lines Representing Data**:
   - **Actual Price Changes** (black line): Represents the net percent of businesses reporting actual price changes over the past three months.
   - **Planned Price Changes** (black line): Indicates the net percent of businesses planning price changes over the next three months.
3. **Trends**:
   - **Steady Periods**: Both actual and planned price changes show relative stability with minor fluctuations from the mid-80s until the mid-2000s.
   - **Significant Variations**: Notable spikes and drops, particularly around the years of the financial crisis (2008-2009) and more recently around 2020-2022.
   - **Correlation**: The actual and planned price changes lines appear closely correlated over the years.
4. **Recent Trends**: The most significant upward spike in prices occurs after 2020, followed by a sharp drop nearing the end of the data range. This indicates a post-pandemic impact or inflationary pressures followed by a cooling off period.

Overall, the graph suggests that businesses' actual price changes and their plans to change prices have historically been influenced by economic events, with the most drastic changes occurring during periods of financial crises and recent post-pandemic times.
