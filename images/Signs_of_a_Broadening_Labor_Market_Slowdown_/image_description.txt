**Summary:**

The graph from the **Bank of America Institute** illustrates the percentage rate of pay disruptions from 2018 to October 2023. A pay disruption is defined as 12 months of income deposited into a customer account followed by three months of no income.

Key observations are as follows:

- The pay disruption rate experienced a marked peak in 2020, reaching approximately 3.0%. This spike corresponds with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which likely led to widespread economic disruptions and job losses.
- Following the 2020 peak, the pay disruption rate gradually declined throughout 2021 and remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations from 2022 to early 2023.
- In 2023, there has been a noticeable rise in the pay disruption rate, indicating increasing economic or employment instability.

The **3-month moving average** (dotted line) helps smooth out short-term volatility, revealing a clearer trend of the rising disruption rate in 2023.
