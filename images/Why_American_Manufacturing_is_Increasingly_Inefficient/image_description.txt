This graph from The Economist measures productivity and output in manufacturing and overall sectors in the United States, normalized to Q1 1987 = 100. It also compares changes in manufacturing productivity across multiple regions from two time periods: 2000-2011 and 2011-2022. Here are the key insights:

1. **Productivity in the United States**:
    - The graph labeled "1" tracks productivity output per hour in Manufacturing and Overall sectors from Q1 1987 through 2023.
    - Manufacturing productivity has significantly increased, especially between 1995 and 2005, but growth has plateaued recently.
    - Overall productivity has also grown but at a slower and steadier rate compared to manufacturing.

2. **Manufacturing % change by region**:
    - The bar chart labeled "2" shows percentage changes in manufacturing productivity for four regions between two periods: 2000-2011 and 2011-2022.
    - **Britain**: Experienced a slight growth from 2000-2011 but saw a much higher increase from 2011-2022.
    - **United States**: Encountered a drop in productivity from 2000-2011 but rebounded with significant growth from 2011-2022.
    - **European Union** (excluding Britain): Had moderate growth in 2000-2011 and a slight increase in 2011-2022, still outperformed by the US in the latter period.
    - **Canada**: Showed negligible growth from 2000-2011 and a minimal decline from 2011-2022.

The data highlights the stronger recovery and productivity growth in U.S. manufacturing in the most recent decade compared to other regions, as well as the general trend of increasing productivity over the past few decades.
