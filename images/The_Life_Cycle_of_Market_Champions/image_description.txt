The image is a line graph that shows the share of total US market capitalization held by the top 10 companies by decade, plotted over the years before and after a given decade’s cohort. Key features of the graph include:

- The x-axis represents the years before and after a given decade’s cohort, ranging from -100 years to 100 years.
- The y-axis represents the share of the total US market cap, ranging from 0% to 35%.
- There are multiple lines shown: 
  - A single blue line representing the 2024 cohort.
  - Several gray lines representing the paths of other decades’ cohorts.
  - A bold black line showing the average path.

Main insights from the graph:
- The share of total US market cap of the top 10 companies tends to rise leading up to a given decade (with peak popularity or dominance around the cohort starting point, marked by year 0) and then generally declines over time.
- The 2024 cohort depicted by the blue line is near its peak in market share.
- Over time, most of the top 10 companies see a decline in their share of the total US market cap after hitting their peak around the cohort starting point.

This graph illustrates the rise and fall of the market dominance of the top 10 companies by decade, highlighting that companies generally peak around the start of their decade and then decline over subsequent decades.
