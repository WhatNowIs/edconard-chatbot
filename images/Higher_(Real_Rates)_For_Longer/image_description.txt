1. **Median Estimates (Green Line)**: Throughout most of the observed period from June 2020 to June 2023, the median neutral rate estimate remains relatively stable at around 0.5%. 

2. **25th Percentile (Red Dashed Line)**: The 25th percentile estimate is consistently below the median, starting at around 0.25% and showing a gradual increase starting in September 2023, reaching around 0.5% by December 2023.

3. **75th Percentile (Black Dashed Line)**: The 75th percentile follows closely to the median until around June 2023 when it starts to increase more sharply, peaking at approximately 1.25% by September 2023, before slightly declining.
