In the image, President Joe Biden is giving a speech at an event where he is promoting job creation, lower costs, and better pay. The setting features American flags and a large blue poster with white text that reads "PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, GOOD JOBS, LOWER COSTS, BETTER PAY."

A group of people, likely union workers, stand on a staircase behind Biden, holding up various supportive signs. These signs read “UNION STRONG,” “IBEW 26 STANDS WITH JOE,” “GO JOE,” “IBEW BIDEN Perfect Union,” and “LET’S GO JOE,” showcasing strong support for Biden and union solidarity. The audience appears to be composed of construction workers and other laborers dressed in work attire such as high-visibility vests and helmets.

This image conveys a clear message of labor union support for President Biden and his policies aimed at supporting workers with better jobs, lower costs, and improved pay.
