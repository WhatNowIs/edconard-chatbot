The image contains two exhibits (graphs) derived from Bank of America's internal data, focusing on credit card balances and after-tax wages and salaries growth across different income groups.

**Exhibit 7: Average Credit Card Balance by Income Groups (Index, 2019 Annual Average=100)**
- The graph shows the change in average credit card balances from 2019 to 2023, segmented by income groups: < $50K, $50K-$125K, and > $125K.
- From mid-2021 onward, lower-income households (< $50K) have seen a significant increase in their credit card balances, surpassing other income groups by mid-2023.
- Middle-income ($50K-$125K) and higher-income (> $125K) groups experienced more moderate increases over the same period, with middle-income nearing 105 and higher-income nearing 101 on the index by 2023.

**Exhibit 8: After-Tax Wages and Salaries Growth by Income Group (% YoY, 3-Month Moving Average, SA)**
- This graph illustrates the year-over-year percentage growth in after-tax wages and salaries, again split by the same income groups.
- There was peak growth in wages and salaries around mid-2021 for all income groups, particularly for higher-income (> $125K) individuals, which saw growth approaching 14%.
- Recently, as of 2023, there is a noticeable decline in wage and salary growth across all income groups, with higher-income individuals showing slightly negative growth, while the middle and lower-income groups hover just above zero or slightly negative.

**Summary:**
These exhibits highlight distinct economic challenges faced by different income groups. Lower-income households have seen a disproportionate rise in credit card balances, indicative of greater financial strain. Meanwhile, growth in after-tax wages and salaries has decelerated across all income brackets, with higher-income groups experiencing a sharper decline recently. This juxtaposition suggests increasing financial stress for lower-income households and slowing wage growth across the board.
