This chart, sourced from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, tracks regional per-capita income as a percentage of the US per-capita income from 1929 to 2020. It highlights several regions: Mideast, Far West, New England, Great Lakes, Rocky Mountain, Plains, Southwest, and Southeast.

Key observations:
1. From 1929 to the 1970s, there was a convergence in per-capita incomes across the regions, meaning regional incomes were becoming more equal.
2. Since the 1970s, this convergence stalled or reversed, with disparities in regional incomes becoming more apparent once again.
3. Specific trends include:
   - The Mideast and Far West regions generally maintained an income level around or above the national average (100%).
   - The Southeast and Southwest have consistently been below the national average.
   - The Plains, Rocky Mountain, and Great Lakes regions have shown considerable fluctuation but tend to hover around the national average.

Overall, the chart underscores the changing dynamics in regional incomes over time, highlighting a period of convergence until the 1970s, followed by a period of divergence or stagnation.
