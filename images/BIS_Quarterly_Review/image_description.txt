The graph contains three panels summarizing the fluctuations of the US dollar in response to varying policy rate expectations across different jurisdictions. Here's a brief overview of each panel:

**Panel A: Futures-implied policy rate paths shifted upwards and rightwards**

- This graph shows the expected policy rate paths for the US (in red) and the EA (Euro Area, in blue) for the periods of 2023 and 2024.
- The lines on this chart represent data as of June 1, 2023 (darker shades), and the latest data available (lighter shades).
- There's a notable upward and rightward shift in the US interest rate path compared to those of the EA, indicating an expectation of higher and more prolonged policy rates for the US.

**Panel B: Yields remained below the implicit YCC ceiling in Japan**

- The graph illustrates the movement of the 10-year swap rate (in red) and the 10-year government yield (in blue) over the periods from Q3 2022 to Q3 2023.
- Despite fluctuations, the yields have generally remained below the implicit Yield Curve Control (YCC) ceiling set by the Bank of Japan (marked with a dotted line).
- The swap rate has shown a significant increase through 2023, whereas government yield movements have been relatively stable but with some upward trend.

**Panel C: US dollar appreciated after wide fluctuations**

- This graph shows the composite dollar index (median in dark red and range in pink) from Q1 2023 to Q3 2023.
- Over this period, the US dollar experienced wide fluctuations but on average appreciated, particularly after significant volatility through mid-2023.
- The start of the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on August 24, 2023, is noted as a key point in the timeline.

**Summary:**
The US dollar has shown considerable fluctuations as policy rate expectations have varied across jurisdictions. In 2023 and 2024, the futures-implied policy rate paths for the US are expected to be higher and extend longer than those of the Euro Area. In Japan, yields have stayed under the controlled ceiling, with a significant rise in swap rates. Despite extensive volatility, the US dollar appreciated by Q3 2023.
