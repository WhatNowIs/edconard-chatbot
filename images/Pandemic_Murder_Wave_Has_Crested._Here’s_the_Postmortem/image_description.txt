The image is a graph depicting the trend of homicide rates in the United States per 100,000 population from 1960 to 2022. Significant points and summaries are as follows:

1. **Title**: "The Pandemic Murder Wave Has Crested" suggests that the recent spike in homicides has reached its peak.
2. **Y-Axis**: Represents the number of homicides per 100,000 population ranging from 0 to 10.
3. **X-Axis**: Timeline spanning from 1960 to 2022.
4. **Data Sources**:
   - Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for the years 1960-2020,
   - AH Datalytics for the years 2021-2022.

**Trend Analysis**:
- **1960s-1980s**: There was a steady rise in the homicide rate, peaking around 1980.
- **1980s-1990s**: The rates fluctuated but remained relatively high, with another peak observed in the early 1990s.
- **1990s-2010s**: A significant decline in the homicide rate is evident, with some fluctuations but overall a general downward trend.
- **2010s-2020s**: The homicide rate remained relatively low until a noticeable increase during the pandemic years, with a peak around 2021-2022.

**Current Observation**:
- The graph indicates that the homicide rate has recently peaked and may be starting to decline, indicating that the "pandemic murder wave has crested."

In summary, U.S. homicide rates have experienced significant fluctuations over the past six decades, peaking around 1980 and the early 1990s, declining notably by the 2010s, and then witnessing a surge during the pandemic years. The recent data suggests a potential leveling off or decline in the rate, post-pandemic.
