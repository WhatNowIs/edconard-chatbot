This chart titled "China: manufactured exports and surplus v WGDP" illustrates the trends in China's manufactured exports relative to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of its trade partners and its manufacturing surplus over the period from 1995 to 2022.

Key points from the chart include:

1. **China's Manufactured Exports (Black Line):**
   - There is a clear upward trend in China's manufactured exports as a percentage of the GDP of its trade partners.
   - Starting from a modest level of around 0.5% in 1995, it rose significantly through the years, reaching around 2.0% by 2005 and continuing to grow steadily.
   - By 2022, China's manufactured exports account for over 4.0% of the GDP of its trade partners.

2. **China's Manufacturing Surplus (Red Line):**
   - The manufacturing surplus remained relatively low and stable until the early 2000s.
   - A notable increase began around 2001, with the surplus growing steadily, albeit with some fluctuations.
   - By around 2008, the surplus approached 2%, followed by a slight dip but recovering to around 1.5% in 2012.
   - Post-2012, there was a fluctuation with growth resuming around 2015 and a marked increase starting from 2019.
   - By 2022, the manufacturing surplus had risen to around 2.5%.

**Summary:** 
Over the span of nearly three decades, China has seen a notable increase in both its manufactured exports relative to the GDP of its trade partners and its manufacturing surplus. The manufactured exports have shown a consistent and steep upward trend, especially notable after the year 2000. The manufacturing surplus also shows a rising trend but with more fluctuations compared to the exports metric. Overall, by 2022, both indicators reach their highest points, signifying China's significant role in global manufacturing and trade.
