The chart titled "New Normal?" presents data on the aggregate weekly payrolls (total hours worked times average hourly pay) and their annualized monthly changes (6mma) across various sectors from 2007 to 2023. The key points include:

1. **Overall Trend**: Total spending on worker pay has been rising at an annual rate of 5%, which is slightly higher than pre-pandemic levels.

2. **Sectoral Insights**:
   - **Total Private Payrolls (blue line)**: Shows modest and steady growth over the years with less volatility compared to individual sectors.
   - **Information (tech, media, and telecoms)**: Exhibits considerable fluctuations, particularly around 2010 and during the pandemic period, with significant recovery afterward.
   - **Manufacturing**: Demonstrates high variability, with notable dips around 2009, possibly reflecting the global financial crisis, and again during the pandemic.
   - **Professional and Business Services**: Shows a similar trend to total private payrolls but with more pronounced peaks and valleys.
   - **Transportation and Warehousing**: Exhibited pronounced increases followed by sharp declines, indicating significant volatility around the pandemic period.
   - **Leisure and Hospitality**: Highly influenced by external shocks, particularly sharp declines during economic downturns such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by substantial rebounds.

3. **Economic Implications**: The rise in total worker pay primarily reflects employment growth rather than increased wages, which could help control inflation. However, there is a potential to see higher interest rates.

4. **Context**: Data sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and calculated by Matthew Klein, offering a comprehensive look at employment trends across various sectors over 16 years.

In summary, while total payrolls are on an increase post-pandemic, the variance among different sectors shows diverse impacts and recovery trajectories, hinting at a complex economic landscape ahead.
