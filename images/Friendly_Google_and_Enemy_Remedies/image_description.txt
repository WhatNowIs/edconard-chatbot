This diagram illustrates the cyclical relationships between Suppliers, Google, and Users, emphasizing Googleâ€™s role as an intermediary. 

1. **Suppliers**:
   - Provide information to Google.
   - Receive traffic directed from Google in exchange.

2. **Google**:
   - Acts as a hub for data received from suppliers.
   - Delivers this data to users in the form of search results.

3. **Users**:
   - Interact with Google by generating clicks through search queries.
   - Provide data back to Google through their search behaviors and selections.

This creates a feedback loop where:
- Suppliers supply data to Google, which is then used to attract user traffic.
- Users interact with Google's search results, generating data that Google uses to refine future results.
- This cycle leads to a continuous exchange of information, traffic, and data among the three entities.
