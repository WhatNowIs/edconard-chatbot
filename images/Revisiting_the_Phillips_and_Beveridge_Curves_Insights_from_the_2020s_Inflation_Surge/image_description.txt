The image features two panels that depict unemployment data over the period from December 2000 to June 2024.

**Top Panel:**
- **Variables**: 
  - The unemployment rate (\(u\)): Indicated by the blue line.
  - The Beveridge-Threshold (BT) unemployment rate: Indicated by the black line.
- **Observations**:
  - The unemployment rate (\(u\)) displayed fluctuations with notable peaks around 2009 and 2020.
  - The BT unemployment rate has lower fluctuations and remains relatively stable compared to \(u\).

**Bottom Panel:**
- **Variable**:
  - The unemployment gap: The difference between the unemployment rate and the BT unemployment rate, depicted by the red line.
- **Observations**:
  - The unemployment gap shows significant spikes corresponding to the peaks observed in the unemployment rate during the same periods (2009 and 2020).
  - At several points, the unemployment gap falls back to around or below 0%, indicating periods where the unemployment rate aligns closely with the BT unemployment rate.

**Grayscale Shaded Areas**:
- Represent periods of economic recessions corresponding to spikes in the unemployment measures.

**Source**:
- Data derived from JOLTS and BLS, as calculated by the authors.

In summary, this figure examines the behavior and relationship of the actual unemployment rate versus a threshold unemployment rate, and explores the resulting unemployment gap, over the period from December 2000 to June 2024. It provides insights into the economic impact and recovery trends during and post-recession periods.
