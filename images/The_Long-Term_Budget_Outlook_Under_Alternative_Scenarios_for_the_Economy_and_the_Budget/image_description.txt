The image is a comparison of Real Gross National Product (GNP) per person under the extended baseline and eight alternative scenarios, presented by calendar year. It is expressed in thousands of 2024 dollars. 

**Left Graph (If sensitivity of private investment to deficits differed):**
- This graph depicts the projected Real GNP per person if the sensitivity of private investment to deficits changes over time.
- There are two scenarios:
  - **Lesser sensitivity** (dashed line): This scenario shows a continual rise in Real GNP per person, reaching around $140,000 by 2054.
  - **Greater sensitivity** (solid line): This scenario shows a slower increase, reaching around $90,000 by 2054.

**Right Graph (If revenues and spending differed):**
- This graph illustrates the impact on Real GNP per person if revenues and spending levels change over time.
- There are two scenarios:
  - **Constant debt-to-GDP ratio** (dashed line): This scenario shows a continual rise in Real GNP per person, reaching about $150,000 by 2054.
  - **Historical averages** (solid line): This scenario exhibits a slower rise, reaching around $100,000 by 2054.

**Conclusion:**
- The scenario with lesser sensitivity of private investment to deficits and the scenario with a constant debt-to-GDP ratio both project a higher trajectory for Real GNP per person by 2054, compared to the scenarios with greater sensitivity and historical averages. This indicates that managing deficits in a way that reduces their impact on private investment and maintaining a constant debt-to-GDP ratio can significantly boost Real GNP per person in the long term.
