The chart depicts the trajectory of Medicare spending per beneficiary if the spending trend had continued consistently versus the actual spending observed. 

Key Information:
1. The time period spans from around 1970 to 2020.
2. Medicare spending per beneficiary has generally increased over time.
3. From 2005 onward, actual spending diverged from the previous trend, growing at a slower pace.
4. By 2020, a significant gap of $3.9 trillion is evident between the projected spending if the trend had continued and the actual spending.
5. Sources for the data include analyses by the New York Times, the Congressional Budget Office, the White House Office of Management and Budget, and the Medicare Board of Trustees.
6. The data has been adjusted for inflation using the G.D.P. price index and reflects mandatory Medicare outlays.

Summary:
Medicare spending per beneficiary has shown robust growth from the 1970s through to 2020. However, after about 2005, the growth rate of actual Medicare spending slowed down, diverging from its previous trajectory. This resulted in a $3.9 trillion reduction in spending by 2020 compared to what would have been expected had the prior trend continued. This data is sourced from several authoritative governmental and economic analyses, adjusted for inflation.
