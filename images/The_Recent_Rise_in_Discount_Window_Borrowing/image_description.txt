Summary:
The graph indicates that the Federal Reserve's outstanding discount window loans experienced a dramatic surge at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This was followed by a sharp decline and a prolonged period of low levels throughout 2020 and 2021. However, recent trends show a gradual increase in these loans starting from 2022, suggesting a change in borrowing patterns or financial conditions.
