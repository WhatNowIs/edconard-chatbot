The graph displays the trend in the U.S. federal budget deficit and its components as a percentage of GDP from 1974 to a projected outlook up to 2034. It highlights three key elements: total deficit, net interest outlays, and primary deficit.

1. **Total Deficit**: 
   - The total deficit has fluctuated significantly over the years, with prominent peaks around the late 2000s and early 2020s.
   - The worst shortfall occurred during the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. **Net Interest Outlays**:
   - These outlays represent the interest payments on the national debt.
   - The interest outlays have remained relatively consistent, but projections indicate an upward trend toward 2034.

3. **Primary Deficit/Surplus**:
   - The primary deficit (or surplus) is the budget balance excluding net interest payments.
   - The graph shows periods of primary surplus in the late 1990s and early 2000s, where revenues exceeded primary expenditures.
   - However, most years reflect a primary deficit, with significant increases around recession periods.

As per the projections extending to 2034, both the total deficit and the primary deficit are expected to remain substantial, highlighting ongoing fiscal challenges. The net interest outlays are also anticipated to grow, suggesting increasing pressure from debt servicing costs on the federal budget.
