The graph in Figure 1 shows trends in the prevalence of pain (specifically FNLBL pain) among 25â€“79-year-old males and females, differentiated by educational attainment (whether they have a BA degree or not) over the survey years from 1995 to 2019.

Key observations include:

1. **Males vs. Females**:
   - The proportion of females reporting FNLBL pain is consistently higher than that of males across all years and education levels.

2. **Education Level Impact**:
   - Individuals without a BA degree (No BA) report more pain than those with a BA degree (BA).
   - Among males, those without a BA degree show higher pain prevalence compared to those with a BA degree.
   - Among females, the same trend is observed, with those without a BA degree showing a higher prevalence of pain compared to those with a BA degree.

3. **Trends Over Time**:
   - For males with a BA degree, the proportion reporting pain remains relatively stable and the lowest compared to other groups.
   - For males without a BA, pain prevalence shows more fluctuation but general steady increase towards the later years.
   - For females with a BA, the proportion reporting pain remains relatively stable at a mid-level compared to the other groups.
   - Females without a BA degree show the highest proportion of reported pain, with noticeable fluctuations but a general increasing trend over time.

Overall, the graph illustrates that education level impacts the prevalence of pain, with those having a BA degree reporting less FNLBL pain, and this effect is observed consistently across genders. Additionally, females report more pain prevalence than males irrespective of their education level.
