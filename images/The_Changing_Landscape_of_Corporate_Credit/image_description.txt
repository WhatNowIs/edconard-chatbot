The image is a line chart depicting the trend in intermediated credit for large firms and small firms from 2002 to 2022. The key points are as follows:

- The chart is titled "The Downward Trend in Intermediated Credit Is Driven by Smaller Firms."

- Two lines are illustrated:
  - Red line represents Small firms (those in the bottom 75th percentile of the size distribution).
  - Blue line represents Large firms (those in the top 25th percentile of the size distribution).

- From 2002 to 2022, the share of intermediated credit for small firms shows a noticeable downward trend, declining from around 60% in 2002 to approximately 50% by 2022.
  
- Conversely, the share of intermediated credit for large firms shows a slight upward trend, starting at around 30% in 2002 and increasing to slightly above 30% by 2022, with minor fluctuations over the years.

- The general pattern indicates that smaller firms are receiving a decreasing share of intermediated credit, while larger firms are relatively more stable with a slight increase.

- Data sources mentioned include Capital IQ Debt Capital Structure and Compustat North America.

The chart effectively illustrates that despite fluctuations in both categories, the overall trend reveals that intermediated credit for smaller firms has decreased over the 20-year period, while the share for larger firms has marginally increased.
