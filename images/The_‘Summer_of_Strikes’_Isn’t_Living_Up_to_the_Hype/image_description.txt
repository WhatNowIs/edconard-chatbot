This image depicts a bar graph entitled "Much Less Time Is Now Lost to Strikes," which charts the days of idleness due to work stoppages as a share of total working time from 1950 through June 2023. The data source is the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, focusing on stoppages involving 1,000 or more workers. 

Key points from the graph include:
- The proportion of days lost to strikes was highest between 1950 and 1980, with notable peaks throughout those years.
- There is a significant decline in work stoppages from the 1980s onwards.
- By the 2000s, the days of idleness due to strikes are much lower, almost negligible, compared to earlier decades.
- The trend continues into the 2020s, with the 2023 figure for June showing a very small share (less than 0.004%).

Overall, the graph highlights a substantial reduction in the percentage of total working time lost due to strikes over the past several decades.
