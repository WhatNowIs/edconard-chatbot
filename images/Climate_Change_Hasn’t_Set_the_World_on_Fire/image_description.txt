The image is a graph titled "Global burned area 2001-22" sourced from NASA and featured in a WSJ photo. It displays the percentage of the global area burned annually from 2001 to 2022. 

Key points:
1. The percentage of global burned area started at around 3.0% in 2001.
2. There was significant variability between 2001 and 2010, with fluctuations ranging from approximately 2.6% to slightly over 3.0%.
3. After 2010, a downward trend is clear, with the percentage of burned area consistently decreasing.
4. By 2022, the burned area decreased to around 2.2%, marked by a red dot labeled "World on fire."

Summary:
This graph illustrates the trend in the global area affected by fires from 2001 to 2022. Despite fluctuations early in the period, the overall trend shows a decline in the percentage of land burned annually, reaching its lowest point in 2022.
