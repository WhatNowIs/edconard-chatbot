This image consists of two charts providing insight into economic growth estimates. 

1. **10-Year Growth Estimate**:
   - This bar chart compares the 10-year growth estimates of different regions/countries, breaking down the contributions from labor force (blue), productivity (red), and total growth (green).
   - Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) shows significant growth driven largely by productivity and labor force contributions.
   - India (IND) displays high total growth mainly from productivity.
   - China (CHN) and Russia (RUS) also show considerable productivity-driven growth.
   - Brazil (BRZ), the USA, Japan (JPN), and Germany (DEU) have lower total growth, with productivity playing a significant role. Germany shows negative growth in the labor force.

2. **Sub-Saharan Africa GDP (%WLD)**:
   - This line chart illustrates several scenarios for Sub-Saharan Africa's GDP as a percentage of World GDP (%WLD) from approximately 2000 to 2050.
   - With a 1% productivity growth, SSA’s GDP percentage is projected to rise to around 3.75%.
   - With a 2% productivity growth, the projection reaches about 6.25%.
   - The most optimistic scenario with 4% productivity growth sees SSA’s GDP potentially reaching above 10%.

**Summary**:
The charts highlight the significant potential for economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially driven by productivity improvements. Over the next decade, SSA and India are expected to see substantial growth contributions from both labor force and productivity, while developed regions like the USA, Japan, and Germany face more modest growth prospects, with labor force growth having less impact. For SSA, different productivity growth scenarios dramatically affect its future share of the world GDP, showcasing how critical productivity improvements can be for its economic standing.
