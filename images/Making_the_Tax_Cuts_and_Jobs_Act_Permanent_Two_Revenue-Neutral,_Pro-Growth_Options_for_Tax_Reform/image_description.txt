This image is a bar chart displaying average growth rates across four economic indicators from 2018 Q1 to 2019 Q4: Real GDP, Consumption, Business Investment, and Nonfarm Payrolls. The chart contrasts predictions made before and after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) with the actual outcomes:

- **Real GDP**:
  - Pre-TCJA Forecast: About 1.5%
  - Post-TCJA Forecast: About 2.5%
  - Actual: Around 2.5%

- **Consumption**:
  - Pre-TCJA Forecast: Around 2.0%
  - Post-TCJA Forecast: Slightly above 2.5%
  - Actual: Just above 2.5%

- **Business Investment**:
  - Pre-TCJA Forecast: Around 3.5%
  - Post-TCJA Forecast: Approximately 4.5%
  - Actual: Slightly below 4.5%

- **Nonfarm Payrolls**:
  - Pre-TCJA Forecast: A little over 0.5%
  - Post-TCJA Forecast: Close to 1.5%
  - Actual: Slightly above 1.0%

In summary, the CBO's post-TCJA forecasts predicted higher growth rates across all four indicators compared to pre-TCJA forecasts. The actual outcomes generally aligned closely with the post-TCJA forecasts, especially for Real GDP, Consumption, and Business Investment. Nonfarm Payrolls grew more than the pre-TCJA forecast but fell short of the post-TCJA forecast.
