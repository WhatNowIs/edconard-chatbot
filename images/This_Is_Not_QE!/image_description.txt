The chart illustrates the composition of United States assets from January 2014 to the early 2020s, with the values shown in billions of USD. The assets are categorized into four types: Domestic Government Assets, Other Assets, FX Securities, and Loans & Repo.

### Key Points:
1. **Time Span**: The data covers from January 2014 to approximately early 2022.
2. **Categories**:
   - **Domestic Government Assets** (Blue): This segment shows a consistent volume until early 2020, after which there is a significant increase.
   - **Other Assets** (Red): This remains relatively stable throughout the period but sees a slight increase in tandem with the rise in Domestic Government Assets after 2020.
   - **FX Securities** (Gray): Not prominent, indicating very low or no significant holdings of Foreign Exchange Securities.
   - **Loans & Repo** (Green): Barely visible and essentially negligible in comparison to other asset classes.
3. **Growth Spike**: The most notable change occurs after January 2020, where there is a sharp increase in Domestic Government Assets, rising to approximately 7.5k USD Bn, implying a response to specific economic conditions or policy changes during this period, possibly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic.
4. **Stability and Variations**: The overall volume of assets appears stable until the large surge witnessed around early 2020.

### Summary:
From January 2014 to early 2022, the United States' asset composition reveals a substantial and consistent holding in Domestic Government Assets and Other Assets, with a sharp rise in these categories post-January 2020. The increase in Domestic Government Assets suggests a reactive measure likely tied to economic events around that period. FX Securities and Loans & Repo remain insignificant throughout the observed timeframe.
