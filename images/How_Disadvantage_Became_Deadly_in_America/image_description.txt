The image consists of three line charts comparing the average age at death across the longevity distribution in developed countries. The charts illustrate the disparity in life expectancy between the United States and other comparable developed countries.

### Key Points:

1. **10% Most Long-Lived:**
   - People in the US who are among the top 10% longest-living have similar life expectancies to those in peer countries.
   - Both the US and peer countries have been experiencing a gradual increase in life expectancy since 1980.

2. **Median:**
   - Median life expectancy in the US shows a consistent gap compared to peer countries.
   - In the US, the median life expectancy is typically 6 years lower than that of other developed nations.

3. **10% Most Short-Lived:**
   - For the bottom 10% of the lifespan distribution, the disparity is far greater.
   - The least fortunate Americans' life expectancy falls significantly behind, with a 20-year deficit compared to the least fortunate in other developed countries.

### Conclusion:
While the US elite enjoy similar life expectancy to those in other developed countries, the most disadvantaged Americans face significantly lower life expectancy. This suggests profound inequality in health outcomes within the US as compared to other developed nations.
