The image presents a graph from "The Economist" depicting the trust-fund asset reserves as a percentage of annual cost for the United States' Social Security old-age insurance and Medicare hospital insurance from 1970 onwards, with a forecast extending to 2034.

Key points in the summary:

1. **Timeframe**: The graph covers historical data from 1970 to the present and includes forecast data up to 2034.

2. **Data Source**: The information is sourced from the Social Security Administration.

3. **Trends in Reserves**:
   - Initially, from 1970, both Social Security old-age insurance (dark blue line) and Medicare hospital insurance (light blue line) had reserves that were inadequate to cover costs, denoted as below the 100% line.
   - Social Security old-age insurance reserves grew significantly, peaking around the year 2010, at which point the reserves surpassed 300% of annual costs.
   - However, following the peak, a sharp decline is projected, indicating a significant reduction in reserves by 2034, expected to drop back to below 100%, marking a potential inadequacy again.
   
4. **Medicare Insurance**:
   - Over time, Medicare hospital insurance reserves experienced fluctuations and slight improvements but consistently stayed below the adequacy threshold (100% line).
   - A slight uptick is visible around the early 2000s but shows a consistent decline afterward, remaining below the adequate reserves to cover costs forecast, even in 2034.

5. **Forecast Insight**: Both programs show a concerning future trend where reserves are projected to deplete to levels inadequate to cover costs, posing a financial challenge for the sustainability of these social security systems.

This graph underscores the looming financial challenges facing the U.S. social security and Medicare systems, highlighting the need for policy intervention to ensure long-term financial sustainability.
