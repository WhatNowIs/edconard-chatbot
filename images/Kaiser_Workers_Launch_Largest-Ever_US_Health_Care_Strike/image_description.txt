The image captures a person, identified by their surroundings as likely part of an organized group, standing on a roadside with a sign that reads, "We are here for Patient Safety." The individual is wearing a red hat and an orange safety vest, indicating they are part of a formal or semi-formal demonstration or movement for healthcare-related issues. The sign also includes identifiers such as "OFNHP" and "AFT Local 5017, AFL-CIO," suggesting that this demonstration is orchestrated by a healthcare labor union advocating for patient safety. This scene appears to be taking place at a busy intersection with several cars passing by, highlighting the public and communicative nature of the demonstration.
