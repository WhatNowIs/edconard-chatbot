The image presents a series of scatter plots that illustrate the cross-county relationship between population growth (change in log of population, y-axis) and extreme temperatures (average of extreme heat and cold days from 1951-2020, x-axis). The plots cover five different decades from 1970-2020. 

Key observations:

1. **Extreme Heat (left column):**
   - Each plot shows the scatter of population growth against the average number of extreme heat days for different decades (1970-1980, 1980-1990, 1990-2000, 2000-2010, and 2010-2020).
   - Slopes of the trend lines are positive but very low in magnitude, ranging from 0.001 to 0.008.
   - This indicates a slight increase in population growth with an increase in the number of extreme heat days, but the relationship is quite weak.

2. **Extreme Cold (right column):**
   - Similar format to the heat plots but for extreme cold days.
   - Slopes of the trend lines are negative and stronger compared to the heat plots, ranging from -0.019 to -0.009.
   - This indicates a more notable decrease in population growth as the number of extreme cold days increases, suggesting people tend to move away from areas experiencing more extreme cold days.

### Summary:
The analysis of the relationship between population growth and extreme temperatures from 1970 to 2020 indicates:
- There is a very weak positive correlation between population growth and extreme heat days.
- There is a moderately stronger negative correlation between population growth and extreme cold days.
Overall, counties with more extreme cold days tend to experience a decrease in population growth, while the increase in extreme heat days does not significantly affect population growth.
