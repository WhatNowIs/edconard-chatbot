The chart illustrates the trends in Chinese GDP allocation between investment and consumption (households and government) from 1978 to 2020.

Key Points:
1. **Investment**: 
   - Shows a general upward trend from 1978, peaking around 2010, and fluctuating slightly thereafter.
   - By 2020, investment remains consistently high, around 40-50% of GDP.

2. **Consumption (Households and Government)**:
   - From the late 1970s to around 2010, consumption as a percentage of GDP shows a declining trend, starting above 60% and falling below 50% by the late 2000s.
   - Post-2010, consumption shows a slight upward trend but remains under 60%.

These trends indicate that China's economic growth has been primarily driven by high levels of investment rather than consumption. The significant and sustained investment levels highlight the country's focus on infrastructure, industrialization, and capital accumulation as key drivers of economic growth. Consumption, although showing a slight increase in the past decade, has not rebounded to earlier levels relative to GDP.
