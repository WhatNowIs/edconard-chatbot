The image presents a line chart titled "Unpleasant Monetary Arithmetic?" that illustrates the trend of U.S. federal government interest payments net of interest income and Federal Reserve dividends as a percentage of Nominal Gross Domestic Product (NGDP) from 1947 to 2022. 

Key Points:

- The chart suggests an increase in the federal budget deficit starting in 2022 due to a rise in U.S. interest rates and yield curve inversion, which has added about 2 percentage points to the deficit.
- The data indicates fluctuations over the decades, with notable peaks around the early 1980s and a sharp increase beginning in recent years after 2020.
- Source information includes calculations by Matthew Klein using data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Overall, the chart highlights the impact of changing interest rates on federal government interest payments relative to the country's economic output over time.
