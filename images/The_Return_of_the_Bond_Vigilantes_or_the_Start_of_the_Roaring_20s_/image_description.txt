The provided chart, titled "Unexplained US Yield Change (October 2022 to May 1st, 2024)," illustrates cumulative yield changes for 10-year (10Y) and 30-year (30Y) bonds. The changes are broken down into two components:

1. **Cumulative yield change around QRA (Quantitative Risk Assessment) announcements [-10, +20] mins** (represented in orange).
2. **Cumulative residual (yield_change ~ SOFR change + oil price change)** (represented in blue).

Key observations:
- For the 10Y bond, there is a significant cumulative yield change around QRA announcements and an even larger unexplained residual, totaling approximately -120 basis points (bp).
- For the 30Y bond, the total unexplained yield change is less pronounced compared to the 10Y bond, but it still shows a combined change close to -40 bp, with contributions from both QRA announcement changes and residual elements.
