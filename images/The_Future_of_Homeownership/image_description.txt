The image is a bar graph illustrating the change in the number of homeowning households in 5-year increments from 1985 to 2060. The key insights from the graph are as follows:

1. **Historical Data (1985-2020)**:
   - There was steady growth in the number of homeowning households from 1985 to 2005.
   - The most significant growth occurred around 2000, with an increase of close to 8 million homeowners.
   - Post-GFC (Global Financial Crisis), there was a noticeable dip around 2010.
   - Growth rebounded in the years following the GFC but did not reach the previous peak levels.

2. **Forecasted Data (2020-2060)**:
   - The trend shows a decline in the number of new homeowners.
   - The projected growth in homeowning households significantly decreases over the decades, starting from around 6 million in the early 2020s and falling gradually to about 2 million by 2060.

3. **Overall Trend**:
   - There is a clear indication that the growth rate of homeowning households is slowing down over the long term.
   - The combination of slowing population growth and other socio-economic factors could be contributing to this decline.
