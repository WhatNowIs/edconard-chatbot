The figure displays the relative application rates to selective colleges by parental income percentile, controlling for test scores.

**Summary:**
- The figure is titled "Application and Conditional Attendance Rates at Selective Colleges by Parental Income, Controlling for Test Scores," with a focus on application rates in subfigure (a).
- The x-axis represents the parent income percentile, ranging from the 0-20th percentile to the top 0.1%.
- The y-axis indicates the relative application rate, starting from 0 and going up to 2.
- Three types of institutions are considered: 
  1. All Ivy-Plus (represented by teal lines with circles)
  2. Flagship Public (represented by orange lines with circles)
  3. Other Selective Private (represented by dark blue lines with circles)

Key Findings:
- For lower income percentiles (0-60%), the relative application rates hover around 1, with little variance among the three types of institutions.
- In the higher income brackets (60-90%), there is a slight decline, but the rates remain close to 1.
- As parental income percentile increases beyond the 90th percentile, a noticeable rise in application rates is seen across all institution types.
  - The rate increases more significantly as parental income approaches and exceeds the 95th percentile.
  - The steepest increase is observed in the "Other Selective Private" institutions, followed by "Flagship Public" and "All Ivy-Plus" institutions.
  
Overall, higher parental income is associated with higher relative application rates to selective colleges, even when controlling for test scores. The trend showcases a pronounced increase in application rates as parental income percentile approaches the highest ranges (95+).
