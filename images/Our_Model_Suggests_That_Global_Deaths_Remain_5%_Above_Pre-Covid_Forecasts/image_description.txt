This image is a graph showing the daily world deaths (in thousands) from 2020 to 2023, marked with significant events related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The graph depicts two types of data: confirmed COVID-19 deaths (illustrated in a light blue area) and excess deaths (illustrated by a red line and shaded area representing the 95% confidence interval).

Key points from the graph:

1. **Significant Events:**
    - **First recorded Beta variant:** Early in the timeline, as the death toll starts to rise.
    - **Delta variant:** Marked around mid-2021, correlating with a significant peak in deaths.
    - **First COVID-19 vaccine given:** Shown before the first major peak in excess deaths.
    - **Omicron variant:** Marked later in the timeline, aligning with another noticeable spike in deaths.
    - **WHO declares emergency over:** Indicated towards the end of the timeline in 2023.

2. **Trends in Deaths:**
    - **Initial rise:** Late 2020, as the pandemic started spreading globally.
    - **Major peaks:** Coinciding with the emergence of variants and notable events:
        - Early 2021 following the emergence of the Delta variant.
        - Late 2021 and early 2022 coinciding with the Omicron variant.
    - **Decrease:** A gradual but noticeable reduction in deaths as the timeline approaches the endpoint in 2023 after the WHO declares the end of the emergency.

3. **Excess Deaths:** 
    - Peaks in excess deaths correspond with peaks in the confirmed COVID-19 death data but are significantly higher, indicating other factors contributing to mortality during these periods.

Overall, the graph portrays the correlation between the emergence of COVID-19 variants, the rollout of vaccines, and the global death toll, suggesting a notable impact of major COVID-19 events on the global mortality rate.
