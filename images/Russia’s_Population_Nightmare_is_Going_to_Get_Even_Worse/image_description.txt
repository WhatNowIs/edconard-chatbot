The graph from The Economist provides a visual representation of births and deaths in Russia from 1990 to 2021. Key points include:

1. **Births and Deaths Overview**:
   - The number of births (depicted in light blue) shows a general decline since 1990, with a minor recovery around the 2010s, but a noticeable decrease again towards the 2020s.
   - The number of deaths (depicted in dark blue) fluctuates but remains relatively high, with a significant increase around 2020-2021.

2. **Net Population Growth**:
   - The shaded area representing "births minus deaths" illustrates negative natural population growth from around 1992 onwards.
   - The negative growth deepened significantly starting from the mid-2010s, reaching a notably low point by 2021.

3. **Significant Trends**:
   - Russia experienced a period where deaths exceeded births, leading to a decrease in natural population growth.
   - The declining trend in births coupled with rising deaths signals a demographic challenge for the country.

In summary, the graph underscores a "birth dearth" in Russia, with persistent natural population decline driven by a combination of lower birth rates and increasing death rates, especially pronounced in recent years.
