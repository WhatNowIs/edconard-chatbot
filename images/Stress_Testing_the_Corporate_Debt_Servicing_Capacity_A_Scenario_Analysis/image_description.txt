This chart, labeled "Figure 6. Percent of Debt at Risk of U.S. Public Nonfinancial Firms," presents the proportion of debt at risk, defined as debt with an Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) less than 2, among U.S. nonfinancial firms with positive book value of debt and positive interest expense. The y-axis represents the percentage of debt at risk, while the x-axis spans from the year 2000 through projected data up to 2026 Q3.

Key Insights:
1. **Historical Data and Projections**: The chart distinguishes between historical/baseline data (solid black line) and two future scenario projections:
   - Stagflation (dashed blue line)
   - Severely Adverse (dotted red line)

2. **Shaded Regions**: Four gray shaded areas denote periods of NBER-dated recessions:
   - March 2001 - November 2001
   - December 2007 - June 2009
   - February 2020 - April 2020
   - Forecasted period Q4 2023 - Q3 2026 is highlighted in blue

3. **Trends**: 
   - From the early 2000s, there’s an observable peak around the first recession period (2001).
   - Debt at risk decreased post-recession, then rose again slightly around the 2007-2009 recession.
   - Post-2009, the debt at risk generally trended downward but increased sharply during the early 2020 recession linked to the COVID-19 pandemic.

4. **Future Projections**: 
   - In the projected period (2023 Q4 – 2026 Q3), under baseline expectations, around 30-40% of debt is anticipated to be at risk, with the risk remaining elevated in both stagflation and severely adverse scenarios.
