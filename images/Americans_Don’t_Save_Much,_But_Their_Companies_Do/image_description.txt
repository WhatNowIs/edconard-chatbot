The image contains two graphs, each illustrating saving behaviors in the United States over time, accompanied by descriptive summaries:

1. **Personal Savings Rate**:
   - **Title**: "Americans Aren’t Great Savers, But That’s OK..."
   - **Summary**: The personal saving rate of Americans has been in decline for about 50 years, with exceptions during brief periods after the Great Recession (around 2008) and the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The saving rate peaked dramatically during the early stages of the pandemic before falling again.
   - **Data Source**: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
   - **Graph**: The saving rate shows fluctuations from 1959, peaking around 35% during the COVID-19 pandemic, before reducing sharply.

2. **Corporate Savings Rate**:
   - **Title**: "... Because American Corporations Save a Lot"
   - **Summary**: American corporations show an overall upward trend in saving rates over the past few decades. The measure of business saving rates, specifically undistributed corporate profits, indicates substantial growth, particularly in recent years.
   - **Data Source**: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
   - **Graph**: The data starts from 1959, with a noticeable upward trend starting around the 1990s. The undistributed corporate profits rise significantly, reaching over $1,500 billion recently.

Both graphs use data sourced from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and provide a comprehensive picture of saving behaviors in the United States, contrasting personal and corporate savings trends over time.
