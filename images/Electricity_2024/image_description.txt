### Additional Notes:
- The data includes electricity consumption from traditional data centers and dedicated AI data centers.
- Excludes consumption from cryptocurrencies and data transmission networks.
- The right Y-axis on the graph denotes the share in total demand in percentage.

### Summary:
The projected data center electricity consumption is set to increase significantly from 2022 to 2026 in all selected regions. The increase is particularly notable in China, where the consumption is expected to rise from around 200 TWh in 2022 to about 320 TWh in 2026, and in the United States from around 210 TWh to about 270 TWh. The share of data center electricity consumption in the overall electricity demand is also expected to rise, with Ireland seeing the most significant increase from 18% to 35% by 2026.
