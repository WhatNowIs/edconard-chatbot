The image illustrates the declining flow of the Colorado River from 1906 to 2022. Key points in the provided data are:

1. **Assumed Allocation**: Water allocations have been made based on an assumed river flow of 17.5 million acre-feet.
2. **Actual Flow Variability**: The actual flow of the Colorado River has often been lower than the assumed allocation.
3. **Historical Data**: The graph charts the river's flow from 1906 to 2022, showing considerable fluctuations.
4. **Long-term Trend**: A noticeable downward trend in the river's flow has been identified, with a dotted line representing this trend over the years.

Overall, the graphic emphasizes the disparity between allocated water resources and the actual water availability from the Colorado River, with a long-term trend of decreasing water flow. This data has significant implications for regional water management and planning. The flow data is sourced from measurements taken at Leeâ€™s Ferry, Arizona, and the provisional values for 2021 and 2022 are included.
