The graph titled "Prime-age labor force participation rates" illustrates labor force participation trends for prime-age men and women from 2000 through December 2023. Key observations are:

1. **Prime-age men (Right axis, green line)**
   - The participation rate started just below 92% in 2000 and consistently declined, with minor fluctuations, to about 88% around 2020.
   - The rate saw a sharper decline during recession periods marked by shaded areas.
   - Post-2020, there was an increase, peaking near 90% in recent times.

2. **Prime-age women (Left axis, blue line)**
   - The participation rate began near 77% in 2000 and trended downwards, reaching about 74% around 2015.
   - This trend also shows declines during recession periods.
   - After a dip around 2020, the rate increased sharply to exceed 76% by the end of 2023.

3. **Recessions (Shaded Areas)**
   - Participation rates for both men and women drop significantly during recession periods, with a noticeable impact during the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.

In summary, prime-age labor force participation for both men and women has shown a general downward trend since 2000, with noticeable declines during recessions. However, there has been a notable recovery post-2020, with participation rates for both genders increasing.
