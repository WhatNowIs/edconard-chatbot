The chart illustrates the real average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees (AHE of prod. and nonsuper) and real median wages in the United States, indexed to 1980 = 100, from 1947 to 2021.

Key points:
1. **Upward Trend (1947 to 1972)**: Both series show a steady increase until around the early 1970s.
2. **Stagnation Period (1972 to 1995)**: There is a notable stagnation and a slight decline in real wages from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s.
3. **Resurgence (Mid-1990s-2000s)**: Around the mid-1990s, real wages begin to pick up again and show a steady increase into the 2000s.
4. **Post-2008 Divergence**: Post-2008 recession period, both indexes show a notable divergence with wages starting to grow again but at different rates.
5. **Recent Trends (2020-2021)**: A sharp increase is noted in both series in the most recent period covered.

Overall, while both metrics show a long-term increase, the path has been marked by periods of stagnation and more recent visible growth, with nuanced divergence between the two wage metrics.
