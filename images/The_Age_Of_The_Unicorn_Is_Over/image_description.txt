This image, sourced from The Economist, titled "Not so magical," presents data regarding venture-capital investment and the number of unicorns (startups valued at $1 billion or more) in the United States from 2013 to 2023.

### Key Points:
1. **Venture-Capital Investment ($bn):**
   - There is a clear upward trend in venture-capital investments from 2013, beginning at a relatively low base.
   - Investments steadily increased, peaking spectacularly around 2021.
   - After 2021, there is a noticeable decline in investments but still higher than early years.

2. **Number of Unicorns:**
   - The number of existing and new unicorns has also shown an upward trend from 2013.
   - By 2023, the number of both existing and new unicorns has substantially increased compared to past years.
   - A significant rise in the creation of new unicorns around 2021 can be observed.

### Summary:
From 2013 to 2023, the U.S. venture-capital investment market and the number of high-value startups (unicorns) have both experienced significant growth. The peak in venture-capital investments occurred around 2021, followed by a decline. However, the number of unicorns has consistently risen, with a noticeable surge in new unicorns around the same period. This indicates a vibrant period for U.S. startups, fostering numerous billion-dollar enterprises despite fluctuating investment levels.
