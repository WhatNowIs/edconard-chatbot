The image is a graph illustrating the foreign-born share of the population in the United States from January 2010 to January 2024. The x-axis represents the years, while the y-axis represents the share of the population, ranging from 14.0% to 18.5%.

Key points from the graph:

1. There are two lines shown on the graph:
   - **Published estimates** (black line)
   - **Authors' estimates** (green line)

2. Both estimates show a general upward trend in the foreign-born share of the population during this period.

3. Initially, from 2010 to 2011, both estimates are similar, starting at just above 15.0%.

4. From 2011 to 2019, the foreign-born share steadily increases, with slight fluctuations.

5. Both estimates dip slightly in 2020 but then rise sharply again post-2020, with a notable increase predicted for 2023 and 2024.

6. By January 2024, the authors' estimates suggest the foreign-born share could surpass 18.0% of the population, while the published estimates also indicate a significant increase, reaching around 18.0%.
