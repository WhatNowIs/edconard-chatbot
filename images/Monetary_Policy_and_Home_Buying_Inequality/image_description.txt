The figure titled "Effect of Mortgage Rates on Fraction of Home Purchase Loans to Lower-Income Households, by Day" examines the impact of mortgage rate changes on the proportion of home purchase loans obtained by lower-income households. 

Key observations:

- The x-axis represents the number of days relative to a specific event (presumably the change in mortgage rates), with Day 0 marked by a red vertical line.
- The y-axis shows the effect on the fraction of home purchase loans, ranging from -0.15 to 0.15.
- The data points (blue dots) depict daily effects, while the vertical lines through these dots likely represent confidence intervals.
- A horizontal dashed line at zero indicates no effect.

Summary:
The graph suggests that there is no significant and consistent effect of mortgage rate changes on the fraction of home purchase loans to lower-income households before and after the event marked on Day 0. The effects fluctuate around zero with some variability, but overall, the changes appear to be minor and not statistically significant. The confidence intervals are relatively wide, indicating a degree of uncertainty in the measured effects.
