The image consists of two charts that provide insights into the relationship between oil prices, the US terms of trade, and the US dollar. Below is a summary of the information presented:

**Chart A: Impact of Higher Oil Prices on US Terms of Trade**
- The bar chart compares the coefficient estimates for the impact of higher oil prices on the US terms of trade across three periods: Q1 1986-Q2 2012, Q3 2012-Q1 2018, and Q2 2018-Q3 2022.
- During Q1 1986-Q2 2012, higher oil prices significantly worsened the US terms of trade, as indicated by a negative coefficient with a two-standard deviation interval extending below zero.
- In Q3 2012-Q1 2018, the impact was close to neutral, with the coefficient close to zero and within a narrower two-standard deviation interval.
- From Q2 2018-Q3 2022, higher oil prices improved the US terms of trade, evident from the positive coefficient, with the two-standard deviation interval above zero.

**Chart B: Constant Relationship Between US Terms of Trade and US Dollar**
- The line chart tracks the index of the US terms of trade (blue line) and the US real effective exchange rate (red line) over time from 1987 to Q3 2022.
- There is a strong and stable relationship between the US terms of trade and the US dollar over the observed period.
- The two indices tend to move together, indicating that changes in the terms of trade are closely correlated with changes in the real effective exchange rate of the US dollar.

**Additional Notes:**
- The estimates for the coefficients in Chart A were derived from a regression equation that includes the terms of trade as the dependent variable and oil prices as the independent variable.
- The data was gathered quarterly from Q1 1986 to Q3 2022.
- Technical details, including the regression methodology, are cited from Rees (2023), and the data sources include OECD and BIS.

**Conclusion:**
The charts suggest that the impact of oil prices on the US terms of trade has shifted over time. Initially, higher oil prices worsened the terms of trade, but this trend reversed from Q2 2018 onwards, where higher prices improved the terms of trade. Additionally, the relationship between the US terms of trade and the US dollar has remained robust and stable over the years.
