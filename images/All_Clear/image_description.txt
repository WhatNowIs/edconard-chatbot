2. **Significant Spike (Early 2020):** There was a significant increase in the annual rate in early 2020, correlating with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a sharp decline.
   
3. **Recent Data (March 2023):** As of March 2023, the annual rate of change is 6.2%, indicating continued lending despite banks cutting back on their holdings of securities.
