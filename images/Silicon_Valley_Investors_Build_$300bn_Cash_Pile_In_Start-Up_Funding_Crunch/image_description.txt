### Summary:
Over the period from 2017 to 2023, US venture capital firms have steadily built up a substantial reserve of unspent capital, often referred to as 'dry powder.' This reserve has grown from around $100 billion in 2017 to a record-high of approximately $300 billion in 2023, indicating a significant increase in available capital that has yet to be deployed into investments. The upward trend reflects a growing accumulation of funds, suggesting either increased capital raising or cautious deployment strategies by VC firms.
