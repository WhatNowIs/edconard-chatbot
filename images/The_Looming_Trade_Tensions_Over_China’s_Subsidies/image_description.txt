The image is a line graph illustrating the rapid growth in three of China's emerging industries from 2015 to 2023. The graph, using a rebased scale (2015=100), compares the trends in battery production, new energy vehicle (NEV) production, and wind and solar power generation capacity. Key observations include:

- **Battery Production (blue line)**: This sector exhibits the most significant growth, showing a steep increase starting around 2020 and continuing upwards to 2023, reaching close to 5,000 by 2023.
  
- **NEV Production (red line)**: Growth in this sector also accelerates from 2019, with a notable rise starting in 2020 and continuing to increase steadily, approaching 3,000 by 2023.
  
- **Wind and Solar Power Generation Capacity (teal line)**: Although it shows a positive growth trend, the increase is more modest compared to the other two sectors, rising steadily and reaching around 1,200 by 2023.
