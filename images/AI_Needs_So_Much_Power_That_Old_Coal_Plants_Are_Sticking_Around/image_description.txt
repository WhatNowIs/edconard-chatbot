The chart illustrates the annual change in US electricity demand over time, using a five-year rolling average. Key points to note include:

1. **Time Frame**: The data spans from about 1955 to 2023.
2. **Trend**: There has been a general decrease in the annual change of electricity demand over the years.
   - **1955-1980**: The change was quite volatile initially, reaching as high as nearly 10% around the late 1950s to early 1960s, before fluctuating and gradually declining through the late 1970s.
   - **1980-2000**: The fluctuations became smaller with peaks and troughs, but overall, the annual change was around 5% or lower.
   - **2000-2020**: The rate continued to decline, reaching near-zero percent around the 2008 financial crisis and remaining relatively low thereafter.
   - **Post-2020**: There is a slight uptick, although it remains under 1%.
3. **Source**: The data is sourced from the US Energy Information Administration, adding credibility to the graph.

The summary of the graph indicates a significant decline in the growth rate of US electricity demand over the last several decades, reflecting a broader trend of stabilization in electricity usage likely due to improvements in energy efficiency, economic shifts, and possibly the impacts of newer technologies.
