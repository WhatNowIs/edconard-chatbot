The graph illustrates the net operating income for four types of real estate—Apartment, Industrial, Office, and Retail—represented as a four-quarter rolling growth percentage from 2000 to 2022. The data is sourced from the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries.

Key points:
1. **Early 2000s**: All sectors demonstrate significant fluctuations, with Retail showing the most volatility.
2. **2007-2009 Financial Crisis**: Notable dip across all sectors, especially in Retail and Industrial properties.
3. **2010-2019**: Post-crisis, the growth rates stabilize with minor fluctuations. Industrial properties generally display positive growth, while Office and Retail are more volatile.
4. **Pandemic Impact (2020)**: Significant negative impact on all sectors, hitting lows around the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
5. **Post-Pandemic Recovery**: Sharp rebound observed in all sectors, particularly in Industrial and Apartment properties, which show strong growth peaks in early 2021.
6. **2022 Trends**: Growth rates begin to plateau or decline slightly after the initial post-pandemic surge, though Industrial properties maintain relatively higher growth compared to others.

Overall, the data reflects significant economic events such as the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, with varying impacts on different types of properties. The Industrial sector demonstrates more resilience and strong growth in the post-pandemic period compared to others.
