This chart, presented by Nikkei Asia and based on U.S. Geological Survey data, illustrates the historic shifts in the percentage share of global rare-earth production between the U.S., China, and other countries from 1960 to January 2023.

Key Points:
1. **1960s to mid-1980s**:
    - The U.S. (blue) dominated global rare-earth production, with its share rising from around 40% to over 60%.

2. **Mid-1980s to mid-1990s**:
    - The share of U.S. production declined significantly.
    - Simultaneously, the share of other countries (grey) increased modestly.

3. **Mid-1990s onward**:
    - China (red) rapidly increased its production share, surpassing the U.S. by 1995.
    - By the early 2000s, China became the dominant producer, accounting for more than 80% of global production.

4. **Recent Trends**:
    - From 2015 onwards, China's dominance slightly declined but still held the majority share of close to 70-80%.
    - The U.S. saw a modest resurgence in production levels by 2023.

The chart underscores China's rise to dominance in the rare-earth market since the mid-1990s, while highlighting a more recent, though limited, revival in U.S. production capacity.
