The graph illustrates cumulative forecast inheritances in trillions of dollars for different generational cohorts from 2021 to 2045. The data, sourced from Cerulli Associates, categorizes the inheritance forecasts for Gen Z, Millennials, Gen X, and Boomers.

Key points from the graph:
- Millennials and Gen X are set to receive the largest inheritances, with Millennials expected to inherit over 25 trillion dollars and Gen X around 20 trillion dollars by 2045.
- Gen Z's cumulative inheritances will grow steadily but remain below the levels forecasted for Gen X and Millennials, reaching about 10 trillion dollars by 2045.
