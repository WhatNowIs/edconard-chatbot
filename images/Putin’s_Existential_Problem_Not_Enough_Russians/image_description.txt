The graph illustrates the total population trends of Russia and the United States from 1980 to 2100, utilizing historical data up to 2021 and projections thereafter.

Key points:
1. **Historical Trends (1980-2021)**:
   - Russia (red line): The population was relatively stable with minor fluctuations around 150 million.
   - United States (blue line): The population experienced steady growth from approximately 225 million to about 330 million.

2. **Projected Trends (2021-2100)**:
   - Russia: The population is projected to decline steadily from around 150 million to nearly 100 million by 2100.
   - United States: The population is projected to continue increasing, reaching close to 400 million by the end of the century.

3. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - By the year 2100, the population of the United States is projected to be about four times larger than that of Russia.
   - The trend underscores a significant divergence in population growth dynamics between Russia and the United States over the 21st century.

The graph is sourced from the United Nations and indicates that while the U.S. population will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace, Russiaâ€™s population is expected to decline considerably.
