The graph titled "Change from January 2020" (Seasonally adjusted) contrasts the Retail Sales and Consumer-Price Index trends from January 2020 onwards. Key points from the graph:

1. **Initial Decline (2020)**:
   - Both Retail Sales and the Consumer-Price Index saw a significant drop at the onset of 2020, coinciding with the recession period marked on the graph.

2. **Recovery and Growth**:
   - Retail Sales (yellow shaded area) rebounded sharply post the initial dip. From mid-2020, they showed a continuous upward trend, peaking at nearly 30% higher than January 2020 levels by 2023.
   - The Consumer-Price Index (black line) also recovered but at a more gradual pace, displaying a steady rise without sharp fluctuations.

3. **Comparison Over Time**:
   - Retail Sales experienced more pronounced growth compared to the Consumer-Price Index. This indicates a robust recovery and growth in consumer spending post-recession.
   - The Consumer-Price Index's trajectory, while steadily increasing, remained relatively modest compared to retail sales.

In summary, post the 2020 recession, retail sales have shown strong recovery and significant growth, nearly reaching a 30% increase compared to January 2020 levels. The consumer-price index has increased gradually alongside, reflecting steady inflationary trends but at a lower rate compared to the boom in retail sales.
