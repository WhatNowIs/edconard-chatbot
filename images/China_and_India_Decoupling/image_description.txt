The image presents a comparative analysis of corporate earnings between China and India, as represented by the MSCI China Index and the MSCI India Index, respectively. The chart spans from January 2004 to January 2024. 

Key points:
- Both indices started at the same baseline in December 2019, normalized to 100 in the Earnings Per Share (EPS) metric.
- For many years from 2004 till around 2021, the MSCI China Index and the MSCI India Index moved relatively in tandem, with minor divergences.
- Starting around January 2021, a significant divergence occurs:
  - The MSCI India Index shows a strong upward trajectory, rising sharply to nearly 225 by January 2024.
  - Conversely, the MSCI China Index shows a declining trend from early 2021, dropping to around 50 by January 2024.
