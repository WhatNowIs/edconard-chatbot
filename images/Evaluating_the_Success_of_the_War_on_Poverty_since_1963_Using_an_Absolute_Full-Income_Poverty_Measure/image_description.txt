This graph displays the trends in the official poverty rate, the absolute full-income poverty rate, and the relative full-income poverty rate in the United States from 1963 to 2019. Here are the key points:

- **Official Poverty Rate (Black line)**:
  - This rate shows fluctuations over the years, starting from around 17% in 1963.
  - It generally declined until the mid-1970s, reaching around 12%.
  - The rate exhibited periodic increases and decreases, corresponding with economic recessions denoted by the grey shading.
  - As of 2019, the official poverty rate has fallen to approximately 10.5%.

- **Absolute Full-Income Poverty Rate (Red line)**:
  - This metric began at about 19% in the early 1960s.
  - It consistently declined over the decades, exhibiting a steady downward trend.
  - By 2019, this rate has decreased significantly to around 1.6%.

- **Relative Full-Income Poverty Rate (Blue line)**:
  - This rate had minor fluctuations but has largely remained stable over the period.
  - It ranges between 15% to 18%, starting around 18% in 1963.
  - As of the latest data in 2019, the relative poverty rate stands at approximately 16%.

**Conclusion**:
  - The absolute full-income poverty rate has seen the most significant reduction, indicating a substantial decrease in the number of people living in absolute poverty.
  - The official poverty rate has also shown a general decline but with more variability, often increasing during periods of economic recession.
  - The relative full-income poverty rate, which measures poverty in relation to the median income, has remained relatively stable over the decades.
