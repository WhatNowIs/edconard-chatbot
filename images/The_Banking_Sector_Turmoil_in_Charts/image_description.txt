This is a bubble chart entitled "2022" that shows the relationship between the percentage of gain/loss (as a percentage of assets) on the vertical axis and the percentage of uninsured deposits (as a percentage of total deposits) on the horizontal axis for various banks. The size of the bubbles represents the total assets of each bank, with larger bubbles indicating greater assets. The chart includes data points for several banks, with major ones highlighted:

1. **J.P. Morgan**:
   - Positioned slightly below the 0 to 2% gain/loss range.
   - Uninsured deposits are slightly below 50% of total deposits.
   - Large in asset size.

2. **Citi**:
   - Positioned near the 0 to -2% gain/loss range.
   - Uninsured deposits are just above 50% of total deposits.
   - Moderately large in asset size.

3. **Bank of America**:
   - Positioned near the -2% gain/loss range.
   - Uninsured deposits are slightly below 50% of total deposits.
   - Large in asset size.

4. **Silicon Valley Bank**:
   - Positioned below the -2% gain/loss range.
   - Very high percentage of uninsured deposits (near 100%).
   - Smaller in asset size compared to the others identified, but still significant.

Overall, this chart provides insights into the financial performance of banks (gain/loss as a percentage of assets) relative to their exposure to uninsured deposits and displays their relative asset sizes. High uninsured deposits and larger asset sizes generally correlate to larger bubbles in the chart. Silicon Valley Bank stands out for having the highest percentage of uninsured deposits and a notable loss percentage.
