The chart illustrates actual and forecasted revenues by AI-exposed sectors, indexed to 100 in the fourth quarter of 2019 (4Q19). The sectors included are Semiconductors, Hardware Enablers (excluding semiconductors), and Software Enablers.

Key points from the chart:

1. **Overall Trend (2019-2025)**: 
   - There is a general upward trend in revenue across all three sectors from 2019 to the projected year 2025.
 
2. **Semiconductors**:
   - Started at the base level (100) in 4Q19.
   - Exhibited more steady but moderate growth compared to the other sectors.
   - Significant surge projected from 2023 onwards, reaching above 220 by 2025.

3. **Hardware Enablers (Excluding Semiconductors)**:
   - Also began at the base level (100) in 4Q19.
   - Displayed steady growth with some fluctuations.
   - Moderate increase expected in the forecasted period, but less pronounced compared to Software Enablers and Semiconductors.
   
4. **Software Enablers**:
   - Started similarly at the base level (100) in 4Q19.
   - Showed notable increases during the actual data period (2019-2022).
   - A significant spike in revenue is forecasted starting from 2023, potentially exceeding 240 by 2025, indicating the highest growth among the three sectors.

5. **Forecast Period (2023-2025)**:
   - Dashed lines indicate the consensus revenue forecasts.
   - All sectors are expected to continue growing with Software Enablers leading, followed by Semiconductors, and then Hardware Enablers.

The chart underscores the considerable increase in AI investment across these sectors, particularly highlighting software and semiconductor sectors as the primary drivers of projected revenue growth in the coming years.
