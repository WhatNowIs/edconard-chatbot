The image consists of two graphs titled "Welfare Change by Age ($ per capita)" and "Wealth Change by Age ($ per capita)" from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), covering the period from July 2021 to February 2023. These graphs provide insights into how welfare and wealth per capita changed across different age groups during this period.

### Graph 1: Welfare Change by Age
- **Horizontal Axis (Age):** 20 to 70 years old.
- **Vertical Axis (Welfare Change):** Ranges from -$20,000 to $60,000.
- **Overall Trend (Black Line):** 
  - Peaks around age 40, indicating the highest increase in welfare at this age.
  - Declines sharply after age 60, showing a decrease in welfare for older age groups.
- **Housing (Blue Dotted Line):** Shows a modest increase up to about age 50 and remains slightly above $0.
- **Equities (Orange Dashed Line):** Increases significantly until age 40, then declines more gradually.
- **Fixed Income (Green Thin Line):** A fairly steady line close to $0.
- **Mortgages (Red Dot-Dashed Line):** Similar pattern to Equities but with less steep changes.
- **Consumer Credit (Red Dotted Line):** Slight increase followed by a slight decline.

### Graph 2: Wealth Change by Age
- **Horizontal Axis (Age):** 20 to 70 years old.
- **Vertical Axis (Wealth Change):** Ranges from -$125,000 to $25,000.
- **Overall Trend (Black Line):**
  - Peaks around age 40 at about $0.
  - Declines sharply after age 50, reaching negative values close to -$125,000 around age 70.
- **Housing (Blue Dotted Line):** Shows a modest increase up to about age 50 and remains slightly above $0.
- **Equities (Blue Dashed Line):** Remains positive and steady, with minor fluctuations.
- **Fixed Income (Green Thin Line):** Slight decline over time.
- **Mortgages (Red Dot-Dashed Line):** Similar to fixed income but slightly more pronounced.
- **Consumer Credit (Orange Dotted Line):** Declines to about -$125,000, particularly for older age groups.

### Summary
Both graphs depict significant changes in welfare and wealth by age from July 2021 to February 2023. Welfare changes peak around age 40 but decline noticeably for those over 60. Wealth changes follow a similar pattern, with wealth generally remaining stable until age 40-50, after which it declines sharply, especially in the oldest age groups. Housing and equities tend to provide moderate positive contributions, while mortgages and consumer credit exhibit more negative impacts on welfare and wealth, particularly in older ages.
