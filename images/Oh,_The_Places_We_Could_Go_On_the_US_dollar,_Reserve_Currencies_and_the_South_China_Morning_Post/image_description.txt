The provided image contains two graphs focusing on U.S. manufacturing and employment trends. Here's a detailed summary:

### Graph 1: US New Orders Less Inventories vs. ISM Manufacturing Index
- **Title**: "US new orders less inventories => ISM manufacturing index"
- **Time Frame**: From 1983 to 2023.
- **Variables**:
  - **ISM Manufacturing PMI Composite Index (left-hand side, blue line)**: Representing overall manufacturing activities. Index values above 50 indicate expansion.
  - **ISM New Orders Less Inventories (right-hand side, brown dotted line)**: A leading indicator for the PMI composite index with a 3-month lead.
- **Observation**: Both indices show cyclical patterns, often fluctuating together. There is evident synchronization, with ISM New Orders Less Inventories leading the primary PMI index. Recent data (as of March 2023) show a sharp decline, potentially indicating a slowdown in the manufacturing sector.

### Graph 2: Unemployment, LFPR, PCE, AHE vs. Nonfarm Payrolls
- **Title**: "Unemployment, LFPR, PCE, AHE => Nonfarm payrolls"
- **Time Frame**: From 2008 to 2024.
- **Variables**:
  - **Non-farm Payrolls (blue line)**: Representing the relative year-over-year change in the number of jobs in the U.S., excluding farm workers.
  - **Regression prediction (brown line)**: A prediction model based on unemployment rate, labor force participation rate (LFPR), personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation, and average hourly earnings (AHE) with a 12-month lead.
- **Observation**: Both the non-farm payroll and regression prediction lines align closely, showcasing predictive strength. Post-2020 there is a sharp dip followed by a rapid recovery, reflecting impacts from economic disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Sources
- Both graphs derive data from credible sources including Bloomberg, JPMAM (March 2023 for the left graph), and Steno Research (April 2023 for the right graph).

### Summary
This image provides an analytical perspective on the U.S. manufacturing sector and the labor market. It highlights significant interdependencies and predictive relationships between new manufacturing orders, inventories, and the ISM manufacturing index. Additionally, it showcases the predictability of non-farm payroll trends using key economic indicators adjusted for lead times. Both graphs collectively indicate potential for foreseeing economic trends based on historical data patterns and statistical modeling.
