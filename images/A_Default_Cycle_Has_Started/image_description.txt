The image displays a graph illustrating the trend of US bankruptcy filings from January 2001 to March 2023. The data, sourced from S&P Capital IQ, Bloomberg, and Apollo Chief Economist, indicates that these filings include public companies or private companies with public debt, having at least $2 million in assets or liabilities at the time of filing or private companies with a minimum of $10 million in assets or liabilities.

Key observations:
1. **Initial Steady Period (2001-2007):** From 2001 to 2007, the number of bankruptcy filings remained relatively low and stable.
2. **Significant Spike (2007-2009):** There was a dramatic increase in bankruptcy filings, peaking around mid-2008 to early 2009, coinciding with the global financial crisis.
3. **Decline and Stabilization (2010-2019):** Post-2009, the bankruptcy filings showed a sharp decline and remained relatively low and stable through the next decade.
4. **Recent Uptick (2020-2023):** A minor increase in bankruptcy filings is observed from 2020 onwards, suggesting a rise from previously low levels.

The shaded areas mark periods of economic downturn or recession where bankruptcy filings peaked, particularly evident during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

In summary, the graph depicts how economic conditions, particularly recessions, significantly influence the number of bankruptcy filings. The recent data suggests a slight increase, potentially due to economic challenges in more recent years.
