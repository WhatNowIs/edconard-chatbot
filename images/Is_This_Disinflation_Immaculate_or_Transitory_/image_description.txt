The image presents a line graph from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, depicting the median 12-month changes in hourly wages of employed workers from 1997 to 2023, with a particular focus on job stayers, job switchers, and the total unsmoothed data.

Key points summarized:
1. **Post-Reopening Acceleration**: Worker pay growth has accelerated since economic reopening post-pandemic, with the most significant increases for workers who switched jobs.
2. **Wage Growth Pattern**: Since mid-2022, the wage growth rate for job switchers has been tapering off, yet it remains notably higher than the pre-pandemic levels by approximately two percentage points for all workers.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: The graph shows that job switchers (red line) have consistently seen higher wage growth compared to job stayers (blue line) throughout the period, markedly so in recent years.
4. **Historical Data**: Over the years, both job switchers and stayers saw fluctuations in wage growth, with notable declines during recession periods such as 2008.
5. **Current Trends**: As of 2023, wage growth for job switchers is high but has shown signs of deceleration.

Overall, the data suggests an evolving labor market where job mobility post-pandemic has led to significant wage increases, though this dynamic is beginning to stabilize.
