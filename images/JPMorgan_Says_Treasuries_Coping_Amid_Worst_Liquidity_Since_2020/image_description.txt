The image is a line chart titled "Bond Liquidity Stress Below Pandemic High Despite Swings". It shows the comparison of the Treasuries liquidity index (black line, right y-axis scaling) and the MOVE Index of Volatility (red line, left y-axis scaling) over a period from early 2020 to 2023. 

Key observations include:
- A major spike in both indexes occurred around early 2020, highlighting significant stress during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- The Treasuries liquidity index reached a peak level of around 180, while the MOVE index surged close to 3.0 during this spike.
- Post-2020, both indexes show fluctuations but remained below their pandemic highs despite several subsequent rises and falls.
- Starting around early 2022, both indexes exhibit a rising trend, though not surpassing their initial 2020 peak.
  
The general conclusion conveyed is that the bond market has experienced significant swings in liquidity stress and volatility but has not reached the extreme levels observed during the early pandemic period.
