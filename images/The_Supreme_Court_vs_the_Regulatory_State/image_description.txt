The chart titled "Regulatory Barometers" presents the annual number of new pages added to the Federal Register and the Code of Federal Regulations over time, tracked from 1961 to 2024. It features two four-year moving averages: one for the Federal Register shown by a blue line, and another for the Code of Federal Regulations indicated by a golden line. 

Key takeaways from the chart:

1. **Federal Register (Blue Line)**:
    - There has been a consistent increase in the number of new pages added to the Federal Register over the years.
    - Particularly noticeable is a sharp increase around the late 1970s and early 1980s, followed by periods of fluctuation.
    - In recent years (from 2017 onward), there is an observable decline followed by another sharp increase.

2. **Code of Federal Regulations (Golden Line)**:
    - From the early 1960s to the mid-1980s, the number of new pages oscillated significantly with several peaks, particularly around the early 1970s.
    - After the mid-1980s, there was a general decline until the mid-1990s, followed by fluctuations characterized by less regular peaks and troughs.
    - Around 2017, there was a noticeable drop, which shows a slight recovery towards the end of the timeline.

3. **Source Information**:
