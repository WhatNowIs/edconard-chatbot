The image is a line graph depicting the U.S. unfilled orders of defense capital goods from 2015 to 2022. The vertical axis represents the value in billions of dollars, ranging from $140 billion to $200 billion. The horizontal axis spans from 2015 through 2020 and beyond, though it is not marked up to the exact present year.

Key points from the graph:
- The value of unfilled orders is seasonally adjusted and includes items such as small arms and ordnance, communications equipment, aircraft, missiles, space vehicles and parts, ships and boats, and search and navigation equipment.
- The data shows fluctuations over the years, starting just above $150 billion in 2015.
- There was a significant rise around 2017, with peaks and troughs indicating periods of increase and decrease in unfilled orders.
- A notable spike occurs around 2018, followed by some decline and slower fluctuations through 2019 and 2020.
- Around 2021, there is a marked increase, reaching close to $190 billion and stabilizing at that level by 2022.

The data suggests significant variability in unfilled orders, with overall growth over the period analyzed. The increase in recent years could indicate heightened defense investment or delayed fulfillment of defense contracts. The source of the data is the Commerce Department.
