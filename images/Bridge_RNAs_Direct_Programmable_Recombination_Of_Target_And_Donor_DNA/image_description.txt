This figure focuses on the concept of bridge RNA donor recoding, which enables fully programmable insertion, inversion, and excision. Here's a detailed summary of the provided panels:

### Panel a (Illustration):
- **Top Section**: It shows a mechanism where thousands of donor and bridge RNA pairs can be utilized for bridging gaps. It outlines the concept of constant and variable regions to facilitate recoding.
- **Bottom Section**: It shows the programming of donor and donor-binding loop with a representation of target DNA, donor DNA, and NGS of recombinants. The process includes binding, recombination, and subsequent selection and sequencing.

### Panel b (Violin Plot):
- The violin plot represents the distribution of read abundance against nucleotide differences to 16281 WT donor. Each violin plot probably corresponds to the results for different nucleotide differences (0 up to 9). The "n" values on top indicate the number of rad sequences for respective nucleotide differences.

### Panel c (Violin Plot):
- This plot shows read abundance against donor-binding loop and donor mismatches, with WT (wild-type) reads being the highest in abundance compared to other mismatches.

### Panel d (Grid Representation):
- A grid that indicates the frequency of donor nucleotides at specific positions for LD (left donor) and RD (right donor) regions. Legends on the grids represent Reacts (%) with heat maps indicating reactivity from 0 to 100%.

### Panel e (Sequence Logo):
- This panel shows a sequence logo representation illustrating the nucleotide preferences in the top 20% of donors. Highlighted regions include core nucleotide positions (constant CT-CG sections).

### Summary:
Bridge RNA donor recoding facilitates highly programmable genetic alterations allowing precise manipulations such as insertion, inversion, and excision. The data visualizes the effectiveness of varying nucleotide differences in donor-recipient pairs, revealing that fewer inconsistencies preserve higher read abundance and success in recombination events. The results underscore specific nucleotide preferences and their position-dependent probabilities in achieving desired genetic edits.
