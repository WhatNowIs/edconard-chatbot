This chart examines the year-over-year (YoY) change in the number of Bank of America customers with a home address in various Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) for the second quarter of 2023. The data is also compared to the housing units-to-population ratio for these MSAs in 2022, based on Census Bureau information. The chart is divided into four quadrants, based on the national housing units-to-population ratio (indicated by the yellow horizontal line) and the 0.0% YoY population change (indicated by the vertical yellow line).

### Key Observations:

#### Top Right Quadrant (High Growth, Higher Units-to-Population Ratio):
- **Nashville**
- **Tampa**
These cities have both positive YoY population growth and higher-than-national-average housing units-to-population ratios.

#### Top Left Quadrant (Decline in Population, Higher Units-to-Population Ratio):
- **St. Louis**
- **Detroit**
- **Miami**
These cities have experienced a decrease in population despite having higher-than-national-average housing units-to-population ratios.

#### Bottom Right Quadrant (Growth, Average/Lower Units-to-Population Ratio):
- **Orlando**
- **Las Vegas**
- **San Antonio**
- **Dallas**
- **Houston**
These cities have experienced population growth but have housing units-to-population ratios that are at or below the national average.

#### Bottom Left Quadrant (Decline, Average/Lower Units-to-Population Ratio):
- **New York**
- **Baltimore**
- **Los Angeles**
- **San Diego**
These cities have seen a decline in population and also have lower or average housing units-to-population ratios.

### Conclusion:
The chart highlights various trends across different cities. Some cities with higher housing availability are losing population, while others with average or lower housing units-to-population ratios are experiencing growth, suggesting a complex interplay between housing availability and population changes.
