The image is a cartoon illustration of a man who appears to be angry or frustrated while reading a newspaper labeled "WSJ" (likely referring to The Wall Street Journal). He is wearing glasses and has a furrowed brow, with his mouth open in what seems to be mid-shout. He is pointing emphatically with one hand while holding the newspaper with the other. In front of him on the table are a bowl of cereal and a steaming cup of coffee, indicating that he might be reacting to the news during breakfast. The background is a solid green color.
