The image is a scatter plot titled "Sensitivity of expected inflation to current inflation," illustrating the relationship between 1-year-ahead expected CPI inflation (on the y-axis) and 4-quarter CPI inflation (on the x-axis).

The plot shows two distinct time periods:
1. **1949:Q1 to 1998:Q4 (in blue)** - Data points for this period suggest a strong positive correlation, indicated by the steep upward blue trend line. It implies that during this period, 1-year-ahead expected inflation rose significantly with an increase in current inflation (4-quarter CPI inflation).
2. **1999:Q1 to 2023:Q2 (in red)** - Data points for this period show a flatter red trend line, suggesting a weaker relationship between current inflation and expected inflation. This implies that after 1999, the sensitivity of expected inflation to current inflation decreased.

The notes below the plot explain the data sources and methodology:
- Before 1981:Q3, the expected inflation data comes from the Philadelphia Fed's semiannual Livingston Survey, interpolated to obtain quarterly values.
- Starting in 1981:Q3, data is sourced from the quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters by the Philadelphia Fed.
- Sources include the Bureau of Labor Statistics, FRB Philadelphia, and authors' calculations.

In summary, the plot demonstrates how the relationship between current inflation and expected inflation has evolved over time, with a noticeable decline in sensitivity from the earlier period (1949-1998) to the later period (1999-2023).
