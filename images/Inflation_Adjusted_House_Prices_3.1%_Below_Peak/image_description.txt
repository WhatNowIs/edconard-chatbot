The image presents a graph comparing the "Affordability Price Index" and "Real Return" of housing from January 1976 to approximately January 2025. Key components include:

1. **Blue Line (Affordability Index)**:
   - Tracks the affordability of housing relative to January 1976 (set as the baseline of 100).
   - Higher values signify less affordability.
   - Peaks notably in early 1980, early 2006, and early 2024, indicating periods when housing was less affordable.
   - Troughs occur around late 1984, early 1998, and late 2011, indicating periods when housing was relatively more affordable.

2. **Red Line (5-Year Real Return)**:
   - Represents the forward-looking real 5-year price increase (annualized for housing).
   - Peaks occur around early 1979, early 1988, and mid-2006, suggesting high expected returns during these periods.
   - Troughs notably in early 1984, early 2008, and late 2010, indicating lower or negative expected returns.

3. **Shaded Blue Areas (Recessions)**:
   - Highlight periods of economic recession.
   - Align with certain peaks and troughs of the affordability index and real return lines, suggesting a correlation between economic downturns and changes in housing affordability and returns.

### Summary:

The graph analyzes the interplay between housing affordability and future real returns on housing investments over nearly five decades. Housing affordability fluctuates significantly, with periods around early 1980, early 2006, and early 2024 showing the highest values, indicating lower affordability. Conversely, periods around late 1984, early 1998, and late 2011 show higher affordability. Real returns also vary, with high expectations around 1979, 1988, and 2006, and low expectations during early 1984, early 2008, and late 2010. Recession periods tend to coincide with significant changes in both affordability and real returns. This data provides essential insights for historical housing market trends.
