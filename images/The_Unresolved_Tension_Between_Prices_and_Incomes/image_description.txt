This chart, sourced from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, analyzes the median 12-month changes in hourly wages of employed workers, using a 3-month moving average (3mma). The data is broken down into three categories: job stayers (blue), job switchers (red), and the total (dotted line).

Key insights include:

1. Worker pay growth has accelerated significantly since the economic reopening post-pandemic.
2. Workers who switched jobs experienced the most dramatic increases in wages.
3. While the additional income gains for job switchers have largely diminished, overall wage growth remains approximately 2 percentage points (pp) higher than pre-pandemic levels.
4. Historically, from 1997 to around 2019, the wage growth for job switchers was typically higher compared to job stayers.
5. Since 2020, there has been a noticeable spike, with wage growth peaking significantly around 2022.

In summary, the economic landscape since the pandemic has led to enhanced wage growth, particularly benefiting those who changed jobs, although the gap between switchers and stayers has narrowed over time.
