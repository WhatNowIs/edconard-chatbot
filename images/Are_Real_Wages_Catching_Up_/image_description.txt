This chart, titled "Figure 1: Wages and Inflation," presents the indexed data on three variables: Real ECI (Employment Cost Index), ECI for compensation in private industry, and CPI-U (Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers) from January 2019 to January 2024.

**Key Points:**

1. **Lines and Variables**
   - The green line represents the Real ECI for compensation of private industry workers, deflated by the CPI.
   - The yellow line shows the ECI for compensation of private industry workers.
   - The blue line denotes the CPI-U for all items.

2. **Indexing Reference**
   - All data are indexed so that 2021 Q1 = 100.

3. **Trends Over Time:**
   - From January 2019 to early 2021, all three indices are relatively stable and hover around the baseline index value of 100.
   - Post-2021, the CPI-U (blue line) shows a notable increase, steeply rising beyond 120 by January 2024.
   - The ECI for compensation (yellow line) also rises post-2021 but at a more moderate pace, reaching above 110 by January 2024.
   - The Real ECI for compensation (green line) shows minimal growth and remains relatively flat, dropping slightly below the baseline of 100 by early 2022, and stays just above 90 through January 2024.

4. **Sources:**
   - The data source mentioned is the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and authors' calculations.

In summary, after a relatively stable period, inflation (CPI-U) rises significantly from 2021 onward, surpassing growth in nominal wages (ECI for compensation). Real wages (Real ECI) adjusted for inflation remain stagnant, indicating that wage growth has not kept pace with rising prices, reflecting a decline in real purchasing power for private industry workers.
