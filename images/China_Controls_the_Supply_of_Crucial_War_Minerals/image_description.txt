The image is a bar chart from "The Economist" titled "Death metals: War minerals, share of production, %". It shows the distribution of production for various strategic minerals among three categories: China, other top suppliers, and the rest of the world, with data from 2022 as reported by the United States Geological Survey.

The chart details the following:

1. **Gallium**: China dominates production.
2. **Niobium**: Brazil is the top supplier, but the rest of the world also has a significant share.
3. **Tungsten**: China is the leading producer.
4. **Vanadium**: China has the largest share of production.
5. **Rare earths**: China overwhelmingly leads in production.
6. **Cobalt**: Congo is a major supplier with significant contributions.
7. **Beryllium**: The United States is the top supplier.
8. **Germanium**: China dominates the market.
9. **Indium**: China leads in production.
10. **Titanium**: China has a significant share.
11. **Antimony**: China is the top supplier.
12. **Tantalum**: Congo is a significant supplier.
13. **Zirconium**: Australia is notable, with the rest of the world having a larger share.

China plays a dominant role in the production of these critical minerals, with only a few minerals like niobium, cobalt, beryllium, and zirconium having significant contributions from other countries like Brazil, Congo, the United States, and Australia, respectively. This information underscores China's strategic position in the global mineral supply chain.
