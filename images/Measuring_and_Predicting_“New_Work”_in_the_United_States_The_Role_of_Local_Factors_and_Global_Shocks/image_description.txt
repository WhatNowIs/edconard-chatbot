This figure, titled "New Work Intensity on Global Shocks and Local Factors by Occupational Tasks," illustrates the heterogeneity of new work intensity (NWI) across different occupational tasks in response to various global shocks and local factors. The shocks and factors analyzed include Technology, Trade, Immigration, Aging, Log Population Density, College Share, Industry Diversity, and Manufacturing Share.

Two occupational groups are examined:
1. **Cognitive Analytical Occupations** (blue marks)
2. **Manual Interactive Occupations** (orange marks)

**Key Observations:**
- **Technology:** Cognitive-analytical occupations show a significant positive correlation with NWI, while manual-interactive occupations show a less strong positive correlation.
- **Trade:** Cognitive-analytical occupations reveal a positive correlation, whereas manual-interactive occupations exhibit a smaller positive or neutral correlation.
- **Immigration:** Both occupational groups show positive correlation, with cognitive-analytical occupations having a stronger relationship.
- **Aging:** Manual-interactive occupations display a positive correlation with NWI, whereas cognitive-analytical occupations have a neutral to slightly positive correlation.
- **Log Pop. Density:** Both occupational groups show no significant correlation.
- **College Share:** Cognitive-analytical occupations show a moderately positive correlation, while manual-interactive occupations show a slightly positive correlation.
- **Industry Diversity:** No significant correlation is observed for either group.
- **Manufacturing Share:** Manual-interactive occupations show a significantly negative correlation, while cognitive-analytical occupations show a neutral correlation.

**Summary:**
The data reveals different responses of occupational groups to global shocks and local factors. Cognitive-analytical occupations tend to be positively correlated with NWI in response to technology, trade, and immigration. Manual-interactive occupations are particularly negatively correlated with NWI when it comes to the manufacturing share and show a positive correlation with aging. This heterogeneity suggests that different occupations adapt variably to the same external pressures, highlighting the need for tailored strategies when considering labor market dynamics and policy responses.
