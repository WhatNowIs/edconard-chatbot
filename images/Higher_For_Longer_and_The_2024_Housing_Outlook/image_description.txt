### Summary:

The image presents two graphs sourced from eMBS and Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, analyzing the current state of mortgage rates compared to historical rates. 

#### Key Points:

1. **Current Mortgage Rates**:
   - The current mortgage rate is 7.63%.

2. **Distribution of Rates on Outstanding Mortgages**:
   - The left graph illustrates the distribution of rates on outstanding mortgages.
   - Most borrowers have mortgage rates significantly below the current market rate.
   - A substantial portion of borrowers have rates between 2.75% and 4.00%.

3. **Financial Disincentive to Move**:
   - The right graph showcases the share of outstanding mortgages with rates 0, 2, and 4 percentage points below the current market rates from 2006 to 2024.
   - As of recent data, nearly all existing mortgages have rates well below the current rate, implying that homeowners are financially disincentivized to refinance or move.
   - Historically, there have been fluctuations, but the gap is currently very high compared to previous years.

#### Conclusion:
The data indicates that most homeowners have mortgage rates far below the current market rate of 7.63%, creating a significant financial disincentive for them to refinance or sell their homes. This situation could potentially stabilize housing markets as homeowners choose to stay with their current loans rather than acquiring new ones at higher rates.
