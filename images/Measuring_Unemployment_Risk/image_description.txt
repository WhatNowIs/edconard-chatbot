The image is a graph titled "Figure 3. Changing unemployment risk by labor force status," which illustrates the distributions of unemployment risk for different labor force status categories across two years, 2007 and 2009. The labels and color code are as follows:

- Employed, 2007 (dark red solid line)
- Employed, 2009 (dark red dashed line)
- Not in labor force, 2007 (olive solid line)
- Not in labor force, 2009 (olive dashed line)
- Unemployed, 2007 (blue solid line)
- Unemployed, 2009 (blue dashed line)

The x-axis represents the percent of the population, while the y-axis represents the unemployment risk in percentage terms.

Key Insights:

1. **Employed Category**: The employed population (both in 2007 and 2009) exhibits very low unemployment risk, generally below 10%, and the distribution is stable, with little change after the Great Recession.

2. **Unemployed Category**: The unemployed population experiences a high and sharply increasing unemployment risk, especially in 2009, with risks going well above 60%. There is a noticeable increase in unemployment risk from 2007 to 2009, suggesting a significant impact from the Great Recession.

3. **Not in Labor Force Category**: For individuals not in the labor force, the unemployment risk is also minimal, but there is a slight uptick in 2009 compared to 2007. This population remains largely unaffected by unemployment risk, similar to the employed category but showing a small increase.

4. **Overall Population Impact**: The graphic shows that the unemployment risk distribution shifted significantly for the unemployed group between 2007 and 2009, reflective of the economic conditions during the Great Recession.

Summary:
The figure highlights the impact of the Great Recession on different segments of the labor force. While employed individuals and those not in the labor force retained low unemployment risk, the unemployed segment saw a sharp increase in risk, particularly pronounced in 2009. This underscores the severe effect of the economic downturn on unemployment.
