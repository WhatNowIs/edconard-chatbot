The image is a line graph illustrating the adjustment of consumer sentiment for asymmetric amplification. It displays both observed (reported) and adjusted sentiment from 2008 to 2024.

Key observations:
1. **Title and Key Message**: "Adjusting for asymmetric amplification raises sentiment by 7 points." Observed sentiment vs. adjusted sentiment is compared over time.
2. **Graph Lines**:
   - **Reported Sentiment** (observed) is represented by a solid blue line.
   - **Adjusted Sentiment** is depicted by a dashed red line.
3. **Sentiment Scale**: The y-axis ranges from 50 to 100, measuring the level of consumer sentiment.
4. **Time Period**: The x-axis spans from the beginning of 2008 to early 2024.
5. **Trends**:
   - Both lines show a significant drop around 2008-2010, reflecting a period of decreased sentiment.
   - A gradual increase in sentiment is observed from 2010 to around 2015.
   - From 2015 to around 2018, sentiment levels out but begins to fluctuate.
   - Around early 2020, there's a notable decline, likely due to external factors such as the pandemic, with continued fluctuations till early 2024.
   - The adjusted sentiment (red dashed line) consistently shows higher sentiment compared to the reported sentiment (blue solid line), averaging an increase of about 7 points due to the adjustment for asymmetric amplification.

6. **Data Source and Note**: 
    - Source: University of Michigan and authors' calculations.
    - Note: The adjusted sentiment measure is calculated by considering the subindex value, mean, and standard deviation of political subindices and overall consumer sentiment index standard deviation. The overall index is a weighted average excluding those with uncertain political affiliation.

**Summary**:
This graph compares observed and adjusted consumer sentiment from 2008 to 2024. Adjusting for asymmetric amplification consistently increases the sentiment by about 7 points. The data illustrates major trends such as the drop in sentiment around the 2008 financial crisis and early 2020, with a general rise in sentiment post-2010. The adjusted measure reveals underlying positivity not captured in the observed sentiment alone.
