The image illustrates the purchases of U.S. securities in 2022 by selected Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) measured in billions of dollars. The graph also includes average annual net purchases for the period from 2013 to 2021 as black dots for comparison. Here are the key insights:

- Middle East Oil Exporters, which include Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and UAE, made the highest purchases of U.S. securities in 2022, exceeding $100 billion, which is significantly higher than their average annual net purchases from 2013 to 2021 (below zero).

- India purchased around $40 billion in U.S. securities, which is significantly higher than its average annual net purchases from 2013 to 2021 (close to zero).
