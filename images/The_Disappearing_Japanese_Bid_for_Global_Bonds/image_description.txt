The image is a stacked area chart illustrating Japan's long-term debt holdings, based on the International Investment Position, with data sourced from the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The chart values bonds at their market value in billions of USD and covers the period from the first quarter of 2014 (Q1-2014) to the third quarter of 2022 (Q3-2022). The chart breaks down the debt holdings into three categories:

1. Banks (represented in blue)
2. Other Financial Corporations (OFCs) (represented in green)
3. Non-Financial Firms (represented in grey)

**Key Observations:**
- Over the period from Q1-2014 to Q3-2022, there is a notable increase in the total debt holdings, peaking and slightly decreasing towards the end.
- Banks have a steady and significant portion of holdings across the entire period.
- OFCs hold a substantial and increasing share of the total debt, making up the bulk of the increase in total debt holdings.
- Non-Financial Firms contribute the smallest share to the total debt holdings, with slight fluctuations but no dramatic changes over the period.

Overall, the chart provides a comprehensive overview of how different sectors in Japan hold and manage long-term debt, highlighting the dominance of OFCs in the growth of market value bonds.
