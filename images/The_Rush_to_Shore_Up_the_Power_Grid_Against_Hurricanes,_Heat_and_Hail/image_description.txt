The image provided is a map of the United States showing the average annual reported power outages per customer from 2019 to 2023. The map details the outages in a gradient scale, where varying shades of purple represent different outage frequencies: 

- Light purple indicates fewer outages.
- Dark purple represents more outages.
- Areas with no data are left in white.

Key observations include:

- The West Coast, especially around Los Angeles, experiences a high frequency of power outages, signified by darker purple shades.
- Other significant hotspots include:
  - Northwestern regions around Seattle.
  - The East Coast, particularly areas around Washington, D.C., and New York.
  - The southeastern regions have pockets of higher outages, notably around Miami and Atlanta.
  - Midwestern areas, particularly near Chicago, show moderate frequencies.
  - The southern parts, including regions around Houston, also seem to experience higher outage frequencies.
- Many areas in the central part of the nation, such as around Denver and surrounding counties, show relatively low frequencies of power outages (lighter shades of purple).
  
This map derives its data from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and was produced by Carl Churchill/WSJ. The reported outages are measured in 15-minute periods, providing a granular view of power reliability across different regions.
