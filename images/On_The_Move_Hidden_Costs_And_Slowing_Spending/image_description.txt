The chart from the Bank of America Institute displays the net population change in major Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), comparing year-over-year percentage changes between the first and second quarters of 2024. A positive value indicates net population inflow, while a negative value represents net outflow. Key insights from the chart include:

1. **Columbus, OH**: Shows significant population inflow, leading all other MSAs.
2. **Southern MSAs**: Present mixed trends. Cities like Austin, Las Vegas, and San Antonio have notable inflows, while others like Miami are experiencing outflows.
3. **Northeastern MSAs**: Predominantly display population outflows, with New York, Boston, and Philadelphia being notable examples.
4. **West Coast MSAs**: San Francisco and Los Angeles are experiencing significant outflows.
5. **Overall Trends**: The chart indicates that while some Southern and Western MSAs are witnessing growth, many Northern and coastal cities are experiencing net population declines.

This data suggests migration patterns, with people moving towards certain Southern cities and away from traditional metropolitan hubs in the Northeast and on the West Coast.
