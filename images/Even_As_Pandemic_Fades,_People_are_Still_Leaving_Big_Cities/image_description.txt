The graph titled "Urban exodus slowed in 2023" illustrates the annual population change by county type for the years 2023, 2022, and 2021. The data is presented as percentage changes and analyzed by Jed Kolko using Census population estimates up to July 1, 2023.

### Summary:

1. **Large Metros: Urban Counties**:
   - 2021: Significant population decline (around -1.5%).
   - 2022: Continued but smaller population decline.
   - 2023: Slight population increase, indicating a reversal of the declining trend.

2. **Large Metros: Higher-Density Suburbs**:
   - 2021: Moderate population growth.
   - 2022: Slight increase in population growth compared to 2021.
   - 2023: Population growth steady and slightly higher than 2022.

3. **Large Metros: Lower-Density Suburbs**:
   - 2021: High population growth (close to 2%).
   - 2022: Slight decline in population growth compared to 2021.
   - 2023: Slight decrease in population growth compared to 2022 but still positive.

4. **Mid-Size Metros**:
   - 2021: Notable population growth.
   - 2022: Marginal decrease in population growth.
   - 2023: Slight increase compared to 2022.

5. **Small Metros**:
   - 2021: Moderate population growth.
   - 2022: Similar growth rate to 2021.
   - 2023: Slight increase in population growth.

6. **Non-Metropolitan Areas**:
   - 2021: Population growth.
   - 2022: Higher population growth compared to 2021.
   - 2023: Highest percentage population growth among all county types but shows signs of slowing down.

### Conclusion:
In 2023, the urban exodus that started in previous years showed signs of slowing. Urban counties in large metros even saw a slight population increase, reversing the decline seen in 2021 and 2022. Higher-density and lower-density suburbs, as well as mid-size and small metros, continued to grow, though the growth rate generally decreased slightly compared to previous years. Non-metropolitan areas maintained the highest growth rates, but also saw a slight decrease compared to previous years.
