The chart illustrates the percent deviation from expected wealth of U.S. families' median wealth compared to expected wealth, across different birth decades, in various years of the Survey of Consumer Finances. Key findings from the chart include:

1. **1940-1949 Birth Decade**: Wealth was significantly above expectations in 2022 (+46%) and slightly above expectations in 2013 (+11%). However, there were minor shortfalls in 2010 (-6%).

2. **1950-1959 Birth Decade**: Families showed a strong positive deviation from expected wealth in 2007 (+45%) and 2022 (+18%). There were notable negative deviations in 2013 (-7%) and 2016 (-18%).

3. **1960-1969 Birth Decade**: Median wealth well exceeded expectations in 2007 (+41%), and 2019 (+38%). However, in 2010, 2013, and 2016, median wealth was below expectations, with the most significant shortfall in 2010 (-29%).

4. **1970-1979 Birth Decade**: Families' wealth substantially surpassed expectations in 2022 (+30%) and marginally in 2019 (+8%). The most considerable shortfall occurred in 2010 (-45%), followed by significant deficits in 2007 (-42%) and 2013 (-28%).

5. **1980-1989 Birth Decade**: In 2022, families had a considerable positive deviation from expected wealth (+28%), while the worst shortfall was in 2016 (-52%). Other significant shortfalls were noted in 2010 (-43%) and 2007 (-34%).

6. **1990-1999 Birth Decade**: A marked positive deviation (+37%) was recorded in 2022, with significant wealth shortfalls in 2019 (-38%) and 2016 (-39%).

Overall, the chart indicates that in 2022, across all birth decades, U.S. families' median wealth was significantly above expected levels. The most prominent positive deviation is seen in the 1940-1949 and 1990-1999 birth decades, while the most negative deviation typically occurred around the period following the Great Recession (2010-2016).
