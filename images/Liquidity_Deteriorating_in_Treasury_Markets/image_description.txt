The image presents a line graph titled "Liquidity worsening in the Treasury market" with data from January 2010 to January 2024. The graph measures the "US government securities liquidity index" indicated by the "Average yield error" on the y-axis, which ranges from 0.0 to 5.0.

Key points observed from the graph:
1. **Initial High Volatility (2010-2014)**: There is a high level of average yield error with peaks around 4.5 in 2010, indicating poor liquidity.
2. **Stabilization and Gradual Increase (2015-2019)**: The yield error stabilizes around 1.0 to 1.5, with occasional minor increases.
3. **Spike in March 2020**: A noticeable sharp rise, likely related to the financial uncertainties brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.
4. **Post-Pandemic Fluctuations (2021-2023)**: After the spike in early 2020, the index stabilizes briefly before increasing again.
5. **Recent High Volatility (2024)**: There is a marked increase in the average yield error reaching around 4.5, suggesting significant liquidity issues.

In summary, the graph shows the liquidity in the US Treasury market has experienced considerable fluctuations over the last decade, with notable spikes during times of financial stress, such as during early 2020, and a significant uptrend in liquidity issues in recent times.
