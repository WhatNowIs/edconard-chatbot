The image consists of four maps of the United States, demonstrating geographical variations in cancer mortality rates, prescription opioid mortality rates, Republican vote share in congressional elections, and the change in Republican vote share over time.

1. **Cancer Mortality Rates in 1996 (Panel a)**:
   - The map illustrates regions with varied levels of cancer mortality.
   - Higher mortality rates are indicated by darker shades of brown, medium to high rates by medium shades, and lower rates by lighter shades.
   - A significant concentration of high cancer mortality rates is observed in the central and eastern parts of the United States, with lower rates in the west.

2. **Prescription Opioid Mortality Rates (1999-2020) (Panel b)**:
   - This map shows the mortality rate due to prescription opioids, with darker shades representing higher rates.
   - Higher mortality rates are observed in parts of the western and some eastern regions of the United States, whereas some regions like the Midwest display lower mortality rates.

3. **Republican Vote Share in Congressional Elections, 1996 (Panel c)**:
   - The distribution of Republican vote share is visualized here, with darker blue shades representing higher Republican vote shares.
   - The central and southern parts of the United States show higher Republican vote shares, whereas coastal regions and certain northern parts have a lower Republican vote share.

4. **Change in Republican Vote Share in Congressional Elections, 2020-1996 (Panel d)**:
   - This map illustrates the change in Republican vote share from 1996 to 2020.
   - Regions in red indicate an increase in the Republican vote share over time, while blue areas show a decrease.
   - Notably, many regions across the country show an increased Republican vote share, particularly in the central United States.

**Notes**: The overall figure connects these geographical distributions, potentially linking higher rates of cancer mortality and prescription opioid mortality to shifts in political voting patterns over time. The figure is referenced in Section III of the source document.
