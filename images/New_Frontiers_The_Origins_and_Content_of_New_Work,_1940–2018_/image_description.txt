The summary of the information presented in the figure is:

### Title:
**Conditional Correlations between Automation, Augmentation, and Employment Growth (based on OLS Regressions)**

### Description:
The figure contains two panels (A and B) with binscatter plots displaying the relationship between employment growth and exposure to augmentation and automation patents. The analysis spans two different periods: 1940-1980 (Panel A) and 1980-2018 (Panel B).

#### Panel A: 1940-1980
- **Left Plot (Augmentation Patents Exposure)**: Employment growth positively correlated with augmentation patents exposure. Regression equation: 
  \[
  \Delta E_j = 1.85 \text{Aug}X_j (0.39) - 1.47 \text{Aut}X_j (0.40) + \gamma + \epsilon_j
  \]
- **Right Plot (Automation Patents Exposure)**: Employment growth negatively correlated with automation patents exposure.

#### Panel B: 1980-2018
- **Left Plot (Augmentation Patents Exposure)**: Employment growth positively correlated with augmentation patents exposure. Regression equation:
  \[
  \Delta E_j = 1.27 \text{Aug}X_j (0.21) - 3.86 \text{Aut}X_j (0.34) + \gamma + \epsilon_j
  \]
- **Right Plot (Automation Patents Exposure)**: Employment growth negatively correlated with automation patents exposure.

### Regression Details:
- **Panel A**: Corresponds to Table VII, Panel A, column (1) using census industry×occupation cells over 1940–1980 (N = 6,520).
- **Panel B**: Corresponds to Table VII, Panel A, column (5) using consistently defined census industry×occupation cells over 1980–2018 (N = 27,380).

Overall, both periods show that augmentation patents have a positive effect on employment growth, whereas automation patents have a negative impact.
