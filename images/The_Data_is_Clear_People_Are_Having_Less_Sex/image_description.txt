This image is a scatter plot with trend lines that show the share of people reporting having sex at least once a month over the last year, segmented by age. The data is derived from the General Social Survey conducted between the years 1989 to 1993 and 2016 to 2022.

Key takeaways from the graph:

1. **Age Range Analysis**:
   - The x-axis represents age, ranging from 20 to 70 years.
   - The y-axis shows the percentage of the population having sex at least once a month, ranging from 40% to 80%.

2. **Comparisons Between Time Periods**:
   - **1989 to 1993**: Represented by the blue line.
     - Peaks slightly above 80% around the age of 30.
     - The percentage declines gradually after the peak but remains higher.
   - **2016 to 2022**: Represented by the red line.
     - Peaks just below 80% around the age of 30, showing a slightly lower peak as compared to 1989 to 1993.
     - The percentage declines more steeply after the peak, particularly in the 30 to 50 age range.

3. **Overall Trends**:
   - In both time periods, the frequency of having sex at least once a month increases with age, peaks around the age of 30, and then declines.
   - There is a noticeable decrease in the percentage of individuals having sex at least once a month in the most recent period (2016 to 2022) compared to the period of 1989 to 1993.
   - The decline with age is steeper in the 2016 to 2022 dataset.

4. **Data Source and Credit**:
   - The data is from the General Social Survey, covering years 1989 to 2022.
   - The image is credited to Ryan Burge and indicates the data source clearly at the bottom right of the plot.

In summary, the graph clearly indicates that while younger adults reported similar rates of sexual activity in both time periods, there is a significant decline in sexual activity among older adults in recent years (2016 to 2022) compared to the late 20th century (1989 to 1993).
