The graph illustrates the share of credit card borrowers who are newly delinquent, categorized by generational cohorts: Baby Boomers, Generation X, Millennials, and Generation Z, over the period from Q1 2015 to Q1 2023. Key points include:

- Millennials (represented by the gold line) show a consistent trend of higher delinquency rates compared to other generational cohorts, particularly post-2020, with rates exceeding pre-pandemic levels.
- Baby Boomers (represented by the red line) and Generation X (represented by the brown line) delinquency rates have generally remained close to their 2019 averages, with slight fluctuations but relatively stable trends.
- Generation Z (represented by the blue line) shows lower delinquency rates overall but with an increasing trend starting from around Q1 2021.
- A sharp drop in delinquency rates can be observed across all generational cohorts around Q1 2020, likely due to economic interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by gradual increases.
