The table titled "Estimated impact of changes in net worth on Excess Retirements" provides a comparative overview of the impact on labor force participation rate (LFPR) for two age groups (55-70 and 55+) over two periods (2019-2021 and 2019-2022). 

Key Data Points:
1. **2019 - 2021**:
   - Age 55-70: 
     - LFPR impact: 0.00376 percentage points (pp)
     - People: 0.99 million
     - % of Excess Retirements: 45.96%
   - Age 55+:
     - LFPR impact: 0.00669 pp
     - People: 1.76 million
     - % of Excess Retirements: 81.79%
   
2. **2019 - 2022**:
   - Age 55-70:
     - LFPR impact: 0.0024 pp
     - People: 0.65 million
     - % of Excess Retirements: 19.73%
   - Age 55+:
     - LFPR impact: 0.0044 pp
     - People: 1.17 million
     - % of Excess Retirements: 35.66%

Summary:
This table indicates the estimated impact of net worth changes on excess retirements. It shows that between 2019 and 2021, the LFPR impact and the percentage of excess retirements were significantly higher compared to 2019-2022 for both age groups. The data suggests that changes in net worth have a more pronounced effect on older populations (55+), particularly for the period from 2019 to 2021, where 81.79% of excess retirements were attributed to changes in net worth, compared to 35.66% in the latter period.
