The graph "America's Battery Manufacturing Boom" provides insights into the trends in US battery manufacturing shipments from 2018 to 2024. Here are the key points:

1. **Measure and Indexing**: The graph represents the "Real Shipments: US Battery Manufacturing," indexed to January 2018 (100).
   
2. **Trend Analysis**: 
   - From 2018 to 2020, the real shipments remained relatively stable, fluctuating slightly below and above the index base of 100.
   - There was a noticeable decline in 2020, which could be associated with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - Post-2020, a gradual recovery is evident, followed by a sharp increase around mid-2022.

3. **Impact of Legislation**: 
   - The graph indicates "IRA Passage" (Inflation Reduction Act) around mid-2022.
   - Following the IRA Passage, there is a significant surge in battery manufacturing shipments, peaking well above the base index of 100, reaching near 150.

4. **Data Sources**: 
   - The real shipments data is derived by deflating nominal shipments using the PPI (Producer Price Index) for Battery Manufacturing.
   - The graph is created by @JosephPolitano using data from the Census and BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics).

Summary:
The graph highlights a substantial increase in US battery manufacturing shipments following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in mid-2022. This suggests that the legislation may have significantly boosted battery manufacturing activities in the country, with shipments rising from a stable phase post-2020 downturn to a new high around 2022-2023.
