The chart titled "US Energy Balance Sheet: Net Imported Energy as a Percent of Total US Energy Consumption 2005-2021|| Estimate 2022" visually represents the trend in the percentage of net imported energy relative to total US energy consumption from the year 2005 to 2021, with an estimate for 2022.

Key points include:

1. **Significant Decrease Over Time**:
   - In 2005, net imported energy constituted 30.17% of total US energy consumption.
   - This percentage has shown a consistent decline over the years.

2. **Transition to Negative Values**:
   - By 2019, net imported energy dropped to approximately 0%, indicating a balance between imported and exported energy.
   - In 2020 and 2021, the US exhibited negative percentages, showing that the country became a net energy exporter.
   - The estimated value for 2022 is -5.6%.

3. **Data Source and Creation**:
   - The data is sourced from eia.gov.
   - The chart and estimate are attributed to "the gregor letter."

4. **Visualization of Data**:
   - The chart uses red bars to represent years with positive net imports (2005-2018).
   - Black bars represent years with negative net imports (2019 onwards).

Overall, the chart demonstrates a significant shift in the US energy balance from a major importer to a net exporter of energy over the given timeframe.
