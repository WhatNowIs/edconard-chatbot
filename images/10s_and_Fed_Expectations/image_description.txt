The image is a financial chart from Apollo detailing the relationship between the market expectations for the number of months until the first Federal Reserve (Fed) cut and the 10-year Treasury yield. Here are some key points presented in the image:

- **Title:** "Fiscal outlook starting to play a role? 10-year Treasury yield no longer driven only by Fed expectations."
  
- **X-axis (Time):** The time frame ranges from October 2023 (Oct-23) to July 2024 (Jul-24).

- **Y-axis (left - months, right - percentage):** The left vertical axis represents the number of months until the first Fed cut (market expectations), ranging from 1 to 9 months. The right vertical axis represents the 10-year Treasury yield percentage, which ranges from 3.8% to 5.0%.

- **Data Plots:**
  - **Green Line:** Tracks the number of months until the first Fed cut (market expectations).
  - **Blue Line:** Tracks the 10-year Treasury yield percentage.

**Observations:**

- **Initial Period (Oct-23 to Jan-24):** Both metrics show a decline:
  - The number of months to the first Fed cut (green line) drops from around 8 to around 2.
  - The 10-year Treasury yield (blue line) decreases slightly from around 4.8% to about 4.0%.

- **Middle Period (Jan-24 to Apr-24):** There are significant fluctuations in both metrics:
  - The number of months to the first Fed cut rises and falls precipitously, indicating market uncertainty.
  - The 10-year Treasury yield also rises and falls but generally trends upward to around 4.7%.

- **Later Period (Apr-24 to Jul-24):**
  - The number of months to the first Fed cut continues to be volatile but trends downwards.
  - The 10-year Treasury yield stabilizes slightly below 4.4% after reaching a peak.

**Conclusion:**
The chart suggests that the fiscal outlook is influencing the 10-year Treasury yield, which is no longer solely driven by Fed expectations. Both metrics exhibit volatility, and their movements appear increasingly independent over the timespan.
