The image shows two graphs representing the distribution of tasks in complexity space: an unbounded distribution on the left and a bounded distribution on the right. 

### Unbounded Distribution:
- **x-axis:** Represents the complexity of tasks.
- **y-axis:** Represents the fraction of tasks.
- The red curve indicates the probability distribution of task complexities.
- The black dashed line labeled "Frontier of automation 2024" depicts the current boundary of tasks that can be automated.
- Tasks to the left of the frontier (shown in gray) are more likely to be automated, while tasks to the right (shown in green) are less likely to be automated.

### Bounded Distribution:
- **x-axis:** Represents the complexity of tasks.
- **y-axis:** Represents the fraction of tasks.
- Like the unbounded distribution, the red curve indicates the probability distribution of task complexities.
- The black dashed line labeled "Frontier of automation 2024" similarly denotes the current boundary of tasks that can be automated.
- Tasks to the left of the frontier (shown in gray) are currently automatable.
- The total task complexity is bounded by a "Maximum complexity" point, beyond which tasks do not exist.
- Tasks to the right of the frontier but within the maximum complexity (shown in blue) represent the tasks that are less likely to be automated in the near future.

### Summary:
The figure contrasts unbounded and bounded distributions of task complexity, emphasizing the current state of automation (as of 2024). It highlights how tasks with lower complexity are more likely to be automated while showing that there is a natural limit to the complexity of tasks in the bounded distribution. The concept of a "Frontier of automation" is used to demonstrate the current technological capabilities in automating tasks of varying complexity.
