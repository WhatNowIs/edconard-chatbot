The image illustrates global capital expenditure on various energy sources from 2015 to a forecasted value in 2023. The energy sources covered include onshore wind, offshore wind, solar PV, and upstream oil & gas (excluding exploration).

Key insights from the data are:

1. **Upstream Oil & Gas**: Investment in upstream oil & gas has seen fluctuations over the years. While there was a decline from 2015 to 2020, a steady increase is observed from 2020 to the forecast for 2023.

2. **Onshore and Offshore Wind**: There has been a gradual increase in capital expenditure on onshore wind energy over the period, with a notable incline anticipated in 2023. Offshore wind investment has grown more significantly since 2020.

3. **Solar PV**: Investment in solar photovoltaic (PV) energy has increased substantially, particularly from 2019 onwards. There is a steep rise in expenditure projected for 2023.

4. **Overall Trend**: The total expenditure on these energy sources combined is growing significantly, particularly from 2020 onwards, with a marked surge anticipated in 2023, reaching over $500 billion.

This indicates a growing global focus on renewable energy investments, particularly in solar PV, onshore, and offshore wind, along with a resurgence in upstream oil & gas investments after a period of decline.
