This chart, titled "Global birth rates," illustrates the total number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime based on contemporary fertility rates from 1950 to 2020. Various regions and selected countries are included, with key lines representing Central Asia (blue), the World average (black), the United Kingdom (green), and China (red). 

Key insights include:

1. **General Decline**: There has been a significant decrease in birth rates globally over the past seven decades. In 1950, the average global birth rate was around 5 children per woman, which has decreased to about 2 by 2020.
 
2. **China**: China experienced dramatic fluctuations, particularly around 1960 with sharp peaks and valleys before a steady decline starting in the 1970s. The birth rate in China is now among the lowest.
  
3. **United Kingdom**: The UK has shown a gradual decline in birth rates from around 2.5 children per woman in 1950 to just under 2 by 2020, with minimal fluctuations.
  
4. **Central Asia**: Central Asian countries have seen diverse trends, with a significant decline from higher rates (~6 children) in the 1950s to below 3 by 2020. A slight increase is noted more recently.
  
5. **Comparison**: Birth rates across globally defined subregions show similar declining trends, with notable differences in the rates of decline and current levels.

This information demonstrates a global shift towards lower fertility rates, reflecting changing socio-economic conditions, policy impacts, and possibly shifts in cultural attitudes towards family sizes.
