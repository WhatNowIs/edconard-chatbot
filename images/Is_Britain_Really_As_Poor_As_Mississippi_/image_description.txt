**Summary:**

This visualization from the Financial Times shows the subnational GDP per capita (in thousands of US dollars, PPP-adjusted) for various regions in the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, and the US. It highlights the economic disparity within these countries, emphasizing how Britain's economy is heavily centered around London.

**Key Points:**

1. **UK:** 
   - London has a significantly higher GDP per capita than other regions.
   - The South East follows with notably lower GDP per capita.
   - Manchester and the North East are far behind, making the disparity clear.
   - If London (the richest region) is removed, the average GDP per capita is considerably lower, even below the poorest US state (Mississippi).

2. **Germany:**
   - Germany shows more balanced distribution compared to the UK.
   - Munich, Stuttgart, and Frankfurt have higher GDP per capita.
   - Saxony-Anhalt represents the lower end of the GDP per capita spectrum.
   - The average GDP per capita without the richest region remains relatively steady.

3. **Netherlands:**
   - Amsterdam tops the list with the highest GDP per capita.
   - Utrecht and Eindhoven are also among the higher end but with less disparity.
   - Removing the richest region (Amsterdam) doesn’t drastically change the national average.

4. **US:**
   - US regions such as San Francisco and New York City have very high GDP per capita.
   - There’s a significant concentration of wealth in a few major cities.
   - States like Mississippi, West Virginia, and Alabama have the lowest GDP per capita.
   - The average GDP per capita decreases moderately when the richest region is removed, indicating substantial regional economic disparities.

This data underscores the economic dominance of London within the UK and highlights the impact of regional economic disparities in comparison to other countries.
