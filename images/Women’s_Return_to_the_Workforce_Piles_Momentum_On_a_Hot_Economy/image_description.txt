The image is a line graph depicting the change in labor-force participation rate among parents with school-age children (ages 5 through 17) since January 2020. It distinguishes between fathers (represented by a blue line) and mothers (represented by an orange line).

Key Points:
1. **January 2020 Baseline**: The graph begins at January 2020, serving as the baseline (0 pct. pts).

2. **COVID-19 Impact**: For both fathers and mothers, there is a significant drop in labor-force participation rates at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. This decrease is more pronounced for mothers, who experience a drop approaching -5 percentage points, compared to the drop to nearly -3 percentage points for fathers.

3. **Recession Period**: The shaded gray area marks a recession period, where both groups hit their lowest points.

4. **Subsequent Recovery**:
   - Fathers’ participation rate fluctuates but shows a general trend towards recovery, peaking above the baseline multiple times.
   - Mothers’ participation shows a slower recovery, with a consistent upward trend nearing the baseline towards the end of the period represented.

5. **Final Trend**: By 2022, both fathers and mothers have nearly returned to their pre-pandemic labor-force participation rates, although mothers are slightly below fathers in terms of recovery.

This graph highlights the considerable initial impact of the pandemic on parents, particularly on mothers, and the gradual recovery of labor-force participation over the subsequent years.
