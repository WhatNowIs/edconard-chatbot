The chart titled "US is importing more from other low-cost Asian countries at China’s expense" highlights the shifting pattern of US imports from various low-cost Asian countries over the period from 2013 to 2022.

Key points:

1. **Total Imports Volume**: 
   - The total imports from these Asian low-cost countries have increased significantly from $0.63 trillion in 2013 to $1.02 trillion in 2022.

2. **Breakdown by Country**:
   - **China**: The proportion of imports from China has declined gradually over the years, though China still makes up a significant share.
   - **Other Countries**: There is a noticeable increase in the proportion of imports from other low-cost Asian countries, including those categorized as "Other" (e.g., Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Singapore, Cambodia).

3. **Specific Countries**:
   - **Vietnam** has shown a marked increase in its share of US imports.
   - **India**, **Malaysia**, **Thailand**, and **Taiwan** have maintained consistent but smaller shares compared to China, with some incremental increases over the period.

4. **Shifts Over Time**:
   - From the early years (2013-2018), China dominated US imports from Asia.
   - A decline in China’s share becomes more apparent from 2019 onwards, coinciding with an increase in imports from other Asian countries.

Overall, the data illustrates a diversification trend in US imports, with a relative decrease in reliance on China and an increase in imports from other low-cost Asian countries. This shift suggests the US is sourcing more goods from a broader range of Asian countries.
