The bar chart titled "Steady As She Goes" presents data on the annualized 2-quarter changes in nominal incomes, categorized into Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Net Domestic Product (NDP). The chart spans from the first half of 2022 (2022H1) to the second half of 2023 (2023H2). Here are the summarized points:

1. **Growth Rates**:
   - In 2022H1, GDP growth was slightly over 7%, while NDP growth was around 6%.
   - In 2022Q3 vs 2022Q1, GDP growth sharply increased to about 8%, and NDP growth was close to 7%.
   - In 2022H2, both GDP and NDP growth rates were similar to their rates in 2022Q3 vs 2022Q1.
   - 2023Q1 vs 2022Q3 saw a slight decline, with both GDP and NDP at just over 5%.
   - In 2023H1, there was a further decline, with GDP and NDP growth rates slightly above 3%.
   - By 2023Q3 vs 2023Q1, growth rates rose again, returning to levels seen in 2022H2.
   - In 2023H2, NDP grew slightly faster than GDP, with both rates reaching levels comparable to those at the end of 2022.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - The growth of nominal incomes remained robust through the periods shown, despite claims that policy is "restrictive".
   - The consistent rate of growth in nominal incomes suggests that reduced demand has not significantly contributed to the observed inflation slowdown.
