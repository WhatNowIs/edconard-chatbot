The image presents a time series graph of global temperature anomalies from 1980 onward, based on land and ocean data. Key elements include:

1. **Title and Source**: The graph is titled "Global Mean Estimates based on Land and Ocean Data" from Lensen et al. (2019).
   
2. **Lines in the Graph**:
   - **GISS T Anomaly (solid line)**: This represents the actual recorded temperature anomalies.
   - **Linear Trend since 1980 (dashed line)**: This indicates the linear progression of temperature anomalies since 1980.
   - **Expected Warming with IMO 2020 (shaded area around dotted line)**: This shows the anticipated warming trend combining the linear trend and the calculated warming effect from the IMO 2020 shock based on the energy balance model. The shaded area represents the upper and lower bounds of this expected warming.

3. **Temperature Anomaly Scale**: The y-axis shows temperature anomaly values ranging from 0.0°C to 1.4°C.

4. **Time Scale**: The x-axis represents years from 1980 to 2030.

5. **Baseline Period**: Temperature anomalies are measured relative to the baseline period between 1951 and 1980.

In summary, the graph portrays the rising trend in global temperature anomalies, showing both observed changes and projected future increases due to ongoing trends and the impact of the IMO 2020 regulation.
