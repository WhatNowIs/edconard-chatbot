**Overall Summary:**
The graphs indicate that the labor market rebalance has helped slow wage growth. The gap between job openings and available workers, which had widened significantly from early 2021, has decreased towards mid-2023. Concurrently, wage growth, which increased notably from 2021 and peaked in late 2022, has slowed to a range between 4½% and 5% in 2023. These dynamics are based on data from various sources and metrics as per Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, Haver Analytics, Linkup, and Indeed.
