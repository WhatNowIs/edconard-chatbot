This graph demonstrates the response of list prices to changes in mortgage rates over a five-week period following an initial shock. The vertical axis denotes the percentage change in list prices, while the horizontal axis represents the number of weeks since the initial shock.

Key observations:
1. There is an immediate decline in list prices of about 1% in the first week following the initial shock.
2. By the second week, the decline in list prices deepens to approximately 3%.
3. The decline continues, reaching around 4% from the third to the fourth week.
4. In the fifth week, the decline stabilizes around 3%.

The shaded area indicates a 90% confidence interval, reflecting the range within which the true change is expected to fall with 90% confidence. The note specifies that these responses are to a one-standard-deviation contractionary shock.

Summary:
The figure illustrates that, in response to a one-standard-deviation contractionary shock in mortgage rates, list prices tend to decrease significantly over the first four weeks before stabilizing. The largest decline is observed around the third week, with a reduction of approximately 4%. The 90% confidence interval highlights the statistical reliability of these observations.
