The image presents data on the projected chances of candidates winning the 2024 presidential election based on 40,000 simulations. The candidates discussed are Biden, Trump, and Kennedy along with a scenario where there is no electoral majority.

Key points:
- **Biden**:
  - Electoral College probability: 33.7%
  - Popular vote probability: 51.0%
  - Predicted electoral votes: 250.4
  - Predicted popular vote share: 47.2%

- **Trump**:
  - Electoral College probability: 65.7%
  - Popular vote probability: 49.0%
  - Predicted electoral votes: 287.2
  - Predicted popular vote share: 47.1%

- **Kennedy**:
  - Electoral College probability: 0.0%
  - Popular vote probability: 0.0%
  - Predicted electoral votes: 0.4
  - Predicted popular vote share: 4.3%

- **No majority**:
  - Electoral College probability: 0.5%

According to this model, Trump is favored to win the Electoral College with a probability of 65.7%, while Biden has a higher probability of winning the popular vote at 51.0%. Kennedy has negligible chances in both Electoral and popular votes. There is also a small chance (0.5%) of no candidate achieving a majority in the Electoral College, possibly due to votes going to a third-party candidate.
