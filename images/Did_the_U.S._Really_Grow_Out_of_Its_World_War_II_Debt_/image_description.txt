The image presents a line graph titled "Figure 2: Primary Balance as a Percent of GDP (Pt)." The data shows the primary surplus as a percentage of GDP over time, spanning from approximately 1945 to 2020. 

- The y-axis represents the primary surplus in percentage terms, ranging from -15% to 10%.
- The x-axis represents the years, starting from 1945 and extending to 2020.

Key observations:
1. In the immediate post-World War II period, the primary balance was positive, peaking above 5%.
2. Over the decades, the primary balance fluctuates, showing periodic surpluses and deficits.
3. There are significant periods of deficits particularly visible in the mid-1970s, early 1980s, early 1990s, and the early 2010s.
4. Since the 2000s, the primary balance shows noticeable volatility, with sharp declines seen around the 2008 financial crisis and again in the early 2020s.
5. The most recent data point indicates a recovery after a steep drop in the early 2020s.

Note: The graph is derived from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and authors' calculations and represents the ratio of the primary balance to GDP. The primary balance is computed as the ratio of the sum of the total fiscal balance plus interest payments to the GDP.
