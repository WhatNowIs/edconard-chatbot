This image shows a graph titled "US Productivity Rebounds in 2023," with a subtitle "Index is now above trend of 2009-2019 expansion." The graph plots the US productivity index from 2000 to 2023, comparing it to the 2009-2019 trend.

Key elements from the graph:
1. **X-Axis (Time):** The timeline spans from 2000 to 2023, marked in increments of five years.
2. **Y-Axis (Index):** The productivity index is shown, ranging from 70 to 111.8.
3. **Dashed Trend Line:** Represents the productivity trend from 2009 to 2019.
4. **Solid Line:** Represents the actual productivity measurement from 2000 to 2023.
5. **Recession Indicators (REC):** Shaded vertical red bands indicate periods of economic recession, occurring around the early 2000s, 2008-2009, and 2020.

Key observations:
- **Initial Period (2000-2004):** Productivity initially fluctuated below the long-term trend during and following the early 2000s recession.
- **2005-2019:** The productivity grew generally along the trend, encountering another dip during the 2008-2009 recession but recovering subsequently.
- **2020 Recession:** A sharp dip occurred around 2020, evident due to the recession (shaded red band), but productivity distinctly rebounded afterwards.
- **2023:** The productivity index has risen above the trend line, reaching 111.8, signaling a notable rebound surpassing the average 2009-2019 growth trajectory.

Summary:
The graph indicates a significant rebound in US productivity in 2023, surpassing the 2009-2019 trend. Despite periods of decline during recessions, particularly in 2008-2009 and 2020, productivity has shown resilience, with a marked recovery as of 2023.
