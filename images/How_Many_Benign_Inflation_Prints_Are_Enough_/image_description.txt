The image presents a bar chart showing the annualized changes in CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation, with data segmented into various periods and categories. 

Here's a detailed summary of the findings:

1. **Time Periods Covered:**
   - 2017-2019
   - 2021H2-2022H1
   - 2022H2
   - 2023H1
   - 2023H2
   - 2024H1

2. **Inflation Categories:**
   - Total CPI
   - Total CPI excluding food, shelter, energy, and used vehicles
   - "Sticky" prices excluding shelter
   - 16% trimmed mean (an alternative measure of central tendency that reduces the effects of outliers)

3. **Trends Observed:**
   - **2017-2019:** Stable and relatively low inflation (around 2% to 3%) across all categories.
   - **2021H2-2022H1:** Sharp spike in inflation, especially in the Total CPI (around 8%), indicating a significant rise in price levels.
   - **2022H2:** A noticeable decrease in inflation compared to the previous period, but still elevated.
   - **2023H1:** Further deceleration in inflation, especially in Total CPI and "Sticky" prices excluding shelter.
   - **Projections for 2023H2 and 2024H1:** Inflation appears to level off, remaining relatively stable across all categories with little expected change.

4. **Key Insight:**
   - The chart suggests that while inflation has decelerated sharply since the beginning of 2023, over the slightly longer term (the past 18 months), there has been minimal change in price growth, indicating that inflation pressures might be stalling out.

5. **Data Sources:**
   - Bureau of Labor Statistics
   - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
   - Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland
   - Matthew Kleinâ€™s calculations

This analysis highlights that despite recent efforts to curb inflation, price growth may not have significantly changed over a longer period, suggesting persistent inflationary pressures.
