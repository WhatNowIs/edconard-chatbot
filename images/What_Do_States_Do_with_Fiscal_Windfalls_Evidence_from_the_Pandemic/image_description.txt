This image consists of four U.S. maps displaying the distribution of pandemic aid per capita across the 50 states. Each map corresponds to a different relief package:

- **Panel A: CARES Act**
- **Panel B: Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA)**
- **Panel C: Recovery and Relief Act (RRA)**
- **Panel D: American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA)**

The states are color-coded into quintiles, from the 1st quintile (lightest color, representing the lowest aid per capita) to the 5th quintile (darkest color, representing the highest aid per capita).

**Observations:**
1. **CARES Act (Panel A)**:
   - States like Alaska and New York received the highest aid per capita.
   - States like Florida and California received lower amounts of aid per capita.
   
2. **FFCRA (Panel B)**:
   - Higher aid per capita is observed in states like New York, North Dakota, and Maine.
   - States such as California and Texas received relatively lower aid per capita.
   
3. **RRA (Panel C)**:
   - High per capita aid is seen in states like New York, Alaska, and North Dakota.
   - States such as California, Texas, and Florida received lower per capita aid.

4. **ARPA (Panel D)**:
   - States like North Dakota and Rhode Island received the highest per capita aid.
   - Many southern states, such as Florida and Texas, received lower per capita aid.

Overall, these visuals provide an easy comparison of state-wise allocation of pandemic aid across four major relief packages, with significant variations among states and packages. This figure was initially part of a study by Clemens and Veuger in 2021.
