This table summarizes the determinants of firm-level total subsidies using firm fixed effects, based on data from Chinese listed firms from 2007 to 2018. The dependent variable across all columns is the "Total Subsidy."

**Key Insights:**

1. **Lagged TFP (Total Factor Productivity)**:
   - Coefficients are consistently negative across all columns, with significance levels in columns (2), (3), and (4) (p<0.05 and p<0.01).
   - Indicates that higher lagged TFP is associated with lower total subsidies.

2. **Lagged Sales Revenue**:
   - Negative coefficients in all columns, statistically significant in columns (3) and (4) (p<0.01).
   - Higher lagged sales revenue correlates with reduced total subsidies.

3. **Lagged Total Assets**:
   - Positive and significant coefficients in all columns (p<0.01).
   - Firms with larger total assets tend to receive more subsidies.

4. **Lagged Net Profit**:
   - Coefficients are positive and significant in columns (3) and (4) (p<0.01), suggesting profitable firms tend to receive more subsidies.

5. **Lagged Employment and IPO**:
   - Coefficients are not significant in any of the columns, suggesting no strong relationship between these variables and the total subsidies received.

**Model Specifics**:
- Columns (1)-(4) use Pseudo-Poisson Maximum Likelihood (PPML) regressions.
- Year and firm fixed effects are included in all models.
- Observations range from 24,218 to 26,869 across models.

This indicates a robust analysis with a large sample size, highlighting the significant role of certain firm-specific characteristics in determining the level of subsidies they receive.
