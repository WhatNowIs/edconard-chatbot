The image is a line graph illustrating household expenditure as a share of GDP for four categories: the U.S., the world, the EU, and China, over a timeline extending from 1980 to approximately 2020. 

Key points from the graph:

1. **U.S.**: The household expenditure starts just below 60% in 1980, increases steadily throughout the period, and reaches around 65% by 2020.
   
2. **World**: The global household expenditure remains fairly constant throughout the period, fluctuating around 55% of GDP with a slight decline towards the end of the timeline.
   
3. **EU**: The EU's household expenditure starts around 55% in 1980, remains relatively stable, and shows a slight declining trend ending around 50% by 2020.
   
4. **China**: China's household expenditure starts at nearly 50% in 1980, shows a substantial decline over the decades, and ends below 40% by 2020. There are a few periods of mild recovery, particularly around the mid-2010s.

The data indicates that household expenditure as a share of GDP is highest in the U.S. throughout the entire period, followed by the world average and the EU, with China showing the lowest and most declining trend. The source of this data is cited as the World Bank.
