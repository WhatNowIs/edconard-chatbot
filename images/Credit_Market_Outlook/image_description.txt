The image illustrates the number of US banks exceeding the 2006 Commercial Real Estate (CRE) loan concentration guidance from March 2021 to March 2023. The data highlights two key categories:

1. Banks with CRE loans at least 300% of risk-based capital and 36-month CRE growth of 50% or higher.
2. Banks with Construction and Development (C&D) loans at least 100% of risk-based capital.

The chart indicates a steady increase in the number of US banks exceeding the 2006 CRE loan concentration guidance over the two-year period. In March 2021, approximately 200 banks had significant CRE loan concentrations, which increased to nearly 700 banks by March 2023.

Key points:
- The number of banks exceeding CRE loan concentration thresholds more than tripled from March 2021 to March 2023.
- Both the number of banks exceeding C&D loan concentration guidance and overall CRE loan concentration guidance saw consistent growth during this period.
