The bar graph, sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), illustrates the annualized change in Average Hourly Earnings for two occupations: Private sector workers and Production and Nonsupervisory workers, covering the period from Q4 2019 to Q2 2023. 

The changes are deflated using both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) as inflation measures. 

Key points:
1. **Private Sector Workers:**
   - Deflated using CPI: Just above 0% (minimal increase).
   - Deflated using PCE: Around 0.5%.

2. **Production and Nonsupervisory Workers:**
   - Deflated using CPI: Around 0.5%.
   - Deflated using PCE: Approximately 1.2%.

This indicates that when considering inflation adjustments, earnings for Production and Nonsupervisory workers have grown more significantly than those for all Private sector workers during this period. The differences in growth rates between CPI and PCE deflators reflect variations in how these inflation measures account for changes in the cost of living and spending.
