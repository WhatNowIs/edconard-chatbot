2. **Q5 Generative AI Exposure (Red Dashed Line)**: This portfolio shows slightly better performance, with an increase in cumulative excess returns that remains modest compared to the AMH Generative AI Exposure portfolio.
3. **AMH Generative AI Exposure (Blue Solid Line)**: This portfolio exhibits the highest performance among the three, showing a significant increase in cumulative excess returns, particularly from late February through March 2023.

An important milestone marked by a dashed red vertical line annotated with "ChatGPT released" is indicated around November 30, 2022. Following this release, there is a notable divergence in the performance of the portfolios, with the AMH Generative AI Exposure portfolio showing pronounced gains.

**Summary**: The chart illustrates the cumulative excess returns for three generative AI exposure portfolios from mid-November 2022 to the end of March 2023. The AMH Generative AI Exposure portfolio significantly outperforms the Q1 and Q5 portfolios, especially following the release of ChatGPT at the end of November 2022.
