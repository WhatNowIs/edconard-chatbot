The image comprises a figure with graphs illustrating the dynamics of credit around systemic banking crises, focusing on different sectors and industries. Below is a detailed summary of the information contained:

**Title:**
- Figure 7: Credit Dynamics around Systemic Banking Crises

**Sub-figures:**
1. **(a) Tradable vs. Non-Tradable Sector**
   - This graph shows the change in credit/GDP ratios for household credit, non-tradable credit, and the tradable sector over a period of -5 to +5 years before and after a banking crisis.
   - Key observations:
     - Household credit and non-tradable credit exhibit a significant decline in the years following a banking crisis.
     - The tradable sector also shows a decline but to a lesser extent compared to household and non-tradable credit.

2. **(b) Tradable Sector Industries**
   - This graph shows the change in credit/GDP ratios for the agriculture and manufacturing/mining industries over the same period.
   - Key observations:
     - Both agriculture and manufacturing/mining sectors exhibit relatively stable credit dynamics with no sharp declines following a banking crisis.

3. **(c) Non-Tradable Sector Industries**
   - This graph shows the change in credit/GDP ratios for construction/real estate (RE), trade/accommodation/food, and transport/communication industries.
   - Key observations:
     - Construction/RE and trade/accommodation/food sectors experience a notable decline in the credit ratio post-crisis.
     - The transport/communication sector shows relatively stable credit dynamics, similar to the tradable sector industries.

**Notes:**
- The figure presents average annual percentage point changes in sectoral credit-to-GDP ratios surrounding 59 systemic banking crises in 90 countries from 1951 to 2009.
- The horizontal axis represents the number of years before and after a crisis. 
- Crisis dates are sourced from Baron et al. (2021) and supplemented with dates from Laeven and Valencia (2018) for countries where no data is reported.

In conclusion, the figure provides a detailed visual representation of how different sectors and industries' credit dynamics are affected around the time of a banking crisis, with non-tradable sectors being more severely impacted than tradable sectors.
