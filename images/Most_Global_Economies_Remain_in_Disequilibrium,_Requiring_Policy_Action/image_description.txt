The image titled "Global Economic and Market Equilibrium 'Checklist'" presents a structured assessment of the economic and market equilibrium measures across eight regions: USA, EUR (Eurozone), JPN (Japan), GBR (Great Britain), CAN (Canada), AUS (Australia), and CHN (China). Each country is evaluated based on several criteria under two main categories: Economic Equilibrium Measures and Market Pricing Equilibrium Measures. The status indicators used are "In" (green), "Near" (yellow), and "Out" (red).

### Summary of Findings:

#### Economic Equilibrium Measures:
1. **Unemployment at Neutral Levels:**
   - In equilibrium: GBR
   - Near equilibrium: JPN, CAN
   - Out of equilibrium: USA, EUR, AUS, CHN

2. **Level of Activity at Potential:**
   - In equilibrium: JPN, GBR, CAN, AUS
   - Near equilibrium: USA, EUR
   - Out of equilibrium: CHN

3. **Inflation at Target:**
   - In equilibrium: JPN, GBR
   - Near equilibrium: USA
   - Out of equilibrium: EUR, CAN, AUS, CHN

4. **Real Growth at Potential:**
   - In equilibrium: USA, GBR, CHN
   - Near equilibrium: EUR, JPN
   - Out of equilibrium: CAN, AUS

5. **Nominal Spending = Productivity + Population Growth + 2%:**
   - In equilibrium: -
   - Near equilibrium: JPN, CHN
   - Out of equilibrium: USA, EUR, GBR, CAN, AUS

#### Market Pricing Equilibrium Measures:
1. **Bond Yield Provides Normal Risk Premium over Cash Rate:**
   - In equilibrium: -
   - Near equilibrium: JPN, CHN
   - Out of equilibrium: USA, EUR, GBR, CAN, AUS

2. **Earnings Yield Provides Normal Risk Premium over Bonds:**
   - In equilibrium: USA
   - Near equilibrium: JPN
   - Out of equilibrium: EUR, GBR, CAN, AUS, CHN

3. **Inflation Is in Line with Breakevens:**
   - In equilibrium: CHN
   - Near equilibrium: -
   - Out of equilibrium: USA, EUR, JPN, GBR, CAN, AUS

4. **Real Yield Provides Normal Risk Premium over Real Cash Rate:**
   - In equilibrium: USA
   - Near equilibrium: JPN, CHN
   - Out of equilibrium: EUR, GBR, CAN, AUS

5. **Discounted Tightening/Easing Is in Line with Growth and Inflation:**
   - In equilibrium: -
   - Near equilibrium: JPN
   - Out of equilibrium: USA, EUR, GBR, CAN, AUS, CHN

### Conclusions:
- **Japan and Great Britain** are relatively closer to economic and market equilibrium compared to other regions, with Japan appearing frequently in "Near" status in several categories.
- **USA** is predominantly out of equilibrium in most areas, despite showing some positive signs in "Real Growth at Potential" and "Earnings Yield."
- **China** demonstrates a mix of near equilibrium statuses but isn't fully in equilibrium in any category.
- Other regions like the **Eurozone, Canada, and Australia** are mostly out of equilibrium, indicating significant economic and market imbalances.

This checklist provides a snapshot of the relative positions of each region's economic conditions and market pricing, with various indicators suggesting areas where more policy or market adjustments may be necessary.
