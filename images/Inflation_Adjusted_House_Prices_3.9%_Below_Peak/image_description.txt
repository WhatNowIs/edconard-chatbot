The image is a line chart titled "Housing: 'Affordability Price Index'" with the affordability price index plotted on the Y-axis (ranging from 0 to 200) and time from January 1976 to January 2023 on the X-axis. The index is set with January 1976 as the base (100). The chart also highlights recession periods in light blue vertical bands.

### Summary:
- **Affordability Trend**:
  - The affordability index peaked twice around 1980-1982, reaching above 180, indicating high housing affordability during those periods.
  - A steady decline follows, reaching the lowest point around 2006-2007 (below 80), implying decreased affordability.
  - Post-2007 peak, there was a significant rise till 2009, then declined slightly after.
  - From around 2010 through 2019, the index stabilized with occasional fluctuations.
  - A notable increase is observed from 2020 to 2022, with a peak nearing 160 in mid-2022, then declining slightly in early 2023.

- **Recession Periods**:
  - The index generally increases during recessions (e.g., 1980-1982, 1990-1991, 2001, 2008-2009, and 2020).
  - Post-recession periods often show a decline or stabilization in the affordability index.

The chart effectively depicts the fluctuations in housing affordability over nearly five decades, with significant rises during economic downturns and variability as the economy stabilizes or grows.
