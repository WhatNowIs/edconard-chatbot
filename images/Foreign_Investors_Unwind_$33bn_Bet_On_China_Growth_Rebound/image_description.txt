This image is a line graph titled "Foreign investors reverse China stock-buying spree." The graph shows net investment flows year to date via the Stock Connect programme in Chinese Renminbi (Rmb bn), and the data goes from Q1 2023 to Q4 2023.

Key points from the graph:

1. **Early 2023:** There is a significant rise in net investment flows, peaking around the beginning of Q3 2023.
   
2. **Mid-2023:** The net investment flows reach around 200 billion Rmb.

3. **Incident Marker:** A notable event is marked where "Country Garden misses bond payments", which occurs around the peak of investment flows.

4. **Post-Mid 2023:** After this peak and the Country Garden incident, there is a sharp decline in net investment flows, which continues downward through Q3 2023.

5. **End of 2023:** By December, net investment flows have dropped significantly, reaching close to zero.

The information suggests that foreign investors initially increased their investments in Chinese stocks significantly through 2023 but then began reversing these investments sharply after Country Garden missed bond payments. This demonstrates a loss of investor confidence and substantial divestment in the latter half of the year. 

The source of the data is FT research and Bloomberg, as of December 27.
