The table titled "Percentage Contributions to Long-Term Federal Fiscal Imbalance" compares data from two studies by Charles Blahous, conducted in 2013 and 2021, showing the percentage contributions of various budget categories to the long-term fiscal imbalance in the U.S. federal budget.

### Summary:
1. **Medicare (net) Contributions:**
   - 2013: 55.4%
   - 2021: 47.1%
   - 2021 (Adjusted Baseline 17.3% of GDP): 52.4%

2. **Medicaid, CHIP, and ACA Exchanges:**
   - 2013: 36.9%
   - 2021: 21.6%
   - 2021 (Adjusted Baseline 17.3% of GDP): 24.4%

3. **Social Security:**
   - 2013: 7.7%
   - 2021: 14.5%
   - 2021 (Adjusted Baseline 17.3% of GDP): 23.2%

4. **Taxes:**
   - 2013: 0.0%
   - 2021: 16.8%
   - 2021 (Adjusted Baseline 17.3% of GDP): 0.0%

### Key Insights:
- The percentage contribution of Medicare to the long-term federal fiscal imbalance has decreased from 55.4% in 2013 to 47.1% in 2021, though it remains at 52.4% when using a baseline of 17.3% of GDP.
- The combined contributions of Medicaid, CHIP, and ACA exchanges significantly dropped from 36.9% to around 21.6% in 2021, with a slight increase to 24.4% in the adjusted scenario.
- Social Security's contribution has nearly doubled, rising from 7.7% in 2013 to 14.5% in 2021, and to 23.2% in the adjusted baseline.
- Taxes were not a contributing factor in 2013 but accounted for 16.8% in 2021 according to the standard baseline calculation, though the adjusted baseline brought it back to 0%.

Overall, these shifts reflect changes in fiscal dynamics over the years and indicate where the most significant pressures lie in terms of long-term federal fiscal imbalances.
