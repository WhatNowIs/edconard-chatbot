The chart, titled "Wage growth faster in immigrant-intensive industries than in others," compares the wage growth in two categories of industries from 2018 to 2023:

1. Industries with high shares of immigrant workers (greater than 25% foreign-born workers).
2. Other industries.

Key takeaways from the chart include:

1. Both categories of industries show an upward trend in earnings indexed to the third quarter of 2018, with the values plotted using a three-quarter moving average.
2. Throughout the specified period, industries with high shares of immigrant workers consistently exhibit higher wage growth compared to other industries.
3. The gap between the two categories increases over time, indicating a more accelerated wage growth in immigrant-intensive industries.
4. By 2023, the index for immigrant-intensive industries reaches close to 130, whereas for other industries, it is just below 125.

The note provides context, stating that high-immigrant industries are defined based on the North American Industry Classification System using American Community Survey data from 2009-2022. The source of the data is the American Community Survey and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, and the analysis has been conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
