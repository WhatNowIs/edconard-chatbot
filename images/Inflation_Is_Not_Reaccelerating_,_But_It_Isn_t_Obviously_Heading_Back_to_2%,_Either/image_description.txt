The chart provided depicts the annualized 3-month changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) from 2010 to 2024, focusing on three different measures: Total CPI, All items less food, energy, shelter, and used cars and trucks, and "Sticky" CPI excluding shelter.

Key observations include:

1. **Inflation Trends**: There are noticeable fluctuations in CPI inflation over the period, with significant peaks and troughs, particularly around 2020, likely influenced by economic responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. **Recent Inflation**: In the first quarter of 2024 (2024Q1), inflation rates were higher across a broad range of measures compared to any comparable period since the end of 2022, indicating faster inflation.

3. **Disinflation in 2023**: The text suggests there was apparent disinflation – a reduction in the rate of inflation – in the second half of 2023 (2023H2), which is contrasted with the faster inflation observed in early 2024.

4. **Variability**: While some of the observed changes in inflation might be attributed to noise or short-term variability, both the sudden rise and prior dip in inflation rates are noteworthy.

The data combined from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and individual calculations provide a comprehensive view of recent inflation dynamics.
