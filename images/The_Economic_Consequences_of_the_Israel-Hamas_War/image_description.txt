The image is a graph showing the decline in oil intensity of global output over the past 50 years. The oil intensity is measured in tons of oil equivalent per $1,000 GDP. 

Key points from the graph:
1. **Time Frame**: The data spans from 1970 to 2020.
2. **Trend**: There's a clear and steady decline in oil intensity over the 50-year period.
3. **Initial Value**: Around 1970, the oil intensity was approximately 0.1 tons of oil equivalent per $1,000 GDP.
4. **Final Value**: By 2020, the oil intensity had decreased to about 0.05 tons of oil equivalent per $1,000 GDP.
5. **Data Sources**: The data comes from the World Bank, BP Statistical Review, and the Energy Institute.
6. **Definition**: Oil intensity is defined as consumption over GDP for each year.

The graph demonstrates that the global economy has become more efficient in its use of oil relative to economic output, nearly halving the oil intensity over the past 50 years.
