The graph depicts U.S. and global trade (exports plus imports) in goods and services as a share of GDP from 1970 to 2020. Key observations include:

1. **Global Trade Trends:**
   - Global trade (represented by the orange line) has seen a significant increase from roughly 25% of GDP in 1970 to over 60% by 2020.
   - There have been fluctuations, notably around the year 2008 during the global financial crisis, where there was a sharp drop, followed by a recovery and further fluctuations in the ensuing years.

2. **U.S. Trade Trends:**
   - U.S. trade (represented by the blue line) also shows an upward trend, starting from about 10% of GDP in 1970 and reaching near 30% by 2020.
   - The U.S. trade share has experienced periods of stagnation and declines, especially notable declines around 2010 and a dip after 2015, followed by a recent upward trend towards 2020.

3. **Comparison:**
   - The global trade share of GDP has consistently been higher than the U.S. trade share throughout the period.
   - While both have shown growth over the 50 years, global trade has increased at a much steeper rate compared to U.S. trade.
