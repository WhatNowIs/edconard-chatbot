**Summary:**
From 2016 to 2020, Georgia experienced notable demographic shifts, with a decline in white voter percentages primarily in urban and suburban locations, particularly around the Atlanta area. These areas coincided with significant swings towards the Democratic Party in the 2020 election. In contrast, some rural regions saw an increase in white voter population and a Republican swing, indicating a geographical polarization in voting patterns and demographic changes.
