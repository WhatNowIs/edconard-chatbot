The graph presents a comparison of road death rates between the US and other developed (OECD) countries, specifically highlighting differences within the US states.

Key Points:
1. **Occupant Deaths per Million People**:
   - The US has consistently higher fatality rates compared to other rich countries. 
   - Most dangerous US states (e.g., MS, SC, AL, WY, NM) experience particularly high rates, while least dangerous states (e.g., NY, MA, RI, NJ, MN) report lower numbers.
   - From around 2005 to 2020, there is a general declining trend, but the rate remains substantially higher than other rich countries.

2. **Occupant Deaths per Billion Miles Travelled**:
   - Similar trends are observed with high occupant death rates in the US per distance travelled.
   - Once again, the most dangerous US states show significantly higher rates than the least dangerous states and other OECD countries.
   - Despite a decrease from 2000 to around 2010, the rates plateau and remain above those of other developed countries.

3. **Pedestrian Deaths per Million People**:
   - The pedestrian death rates also follow a concerning pattern with the US rates being higher than in other rich countries.
   - The disparity is particularly pronounced in the most dangerous US states.
   - Throughout the observed period (2000 to 2020), there is a noticeable increase, especially post-2010, highlighting a growing issue.

Overall, these measures indicate that road safety in the US is significantly worse than in other developed countries, with stark variations within different states. Most dangerous states experience disproportionately higher fatality rates, raising concerns about road safety policies and infrastructure.
