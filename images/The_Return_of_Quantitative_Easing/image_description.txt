The provided image is a graph from the Financial Times that tracks the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and liquidity from January 2019 to approximately mid-2023. The graph presents two primary data series:

1. **Fed Balance Sheet (light blue line, measured in trillions of US dollars)**: This line shows the total assets held by the Federal Reserve over time.
2. **Fed Liquidity (dark blue line, also measured in trillions of US dollars)**: This line represents the amount of liquidity provided by the Federal Reserve to the financial system.

### Key Observations:

- **Pre-2020 Period**: Both the Fed balance sheet and liquidity levels remained relatively stable and low, around the $4 trillion mark for the balance sheet and below $2 trillion for liquidity.
  
- **Early 2020 Spike**: There was a significant increase in both the Fed balance sheet and liquidity around early 2020. This coincides with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the Federal Reserve significantly expanded its balance sheet to stabilize the financial system.

- **Post-2020 Fluctuations**: After the initial surge in early 2020, the Fed's balance sheet continued to grow, peaking at an asset level above $8 trillion by early 2021. Liquidity also increased markedly but exhibited greater volatility.

- **2021-2023 Trends**: The balance sheet saw some fluctuations but generally trended downward after peaking. Concurrently, liquidity showed sharp ups and downs, with notable dips and recoveries.

- **Crisis Events**: The graph marks two specific crises:
  - **Gilt Crisis around October 2022**: There is a dip in liquidity levels aligning with this event.
  - **SVB Collapse around March 2023**: Another significant dip in liquidity is observed around this time.
  
- **Overall Trend by Mid-2023**: Both the balance sheet and liquidity have reduced from their pandemic peaks but remain elevated compared to pre-2020 levels. The balance sheet levels off at around $8 trillion, while liquidity stabilizes around $3-$4 trillion.

### Sources:
The data for this graph was sourced from the US Federal Reserve and CrossBorder Capital, with the definitions for Fed liquidity provided as Fed assets less currency in circulation, less Treasury general account, less reverse repo program, plus operating losses.

### Summary:
The Federal Reserve significantly expanded its balance sheet and provided increased liquidity starting in early 2020 to counteract the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following this, both measures showed fluctuations with liquidity demonstrating higher volatility. Recent crises in financial markets, such as the Gilt crisis and the SVB collapse, have led to noticeable dips in liquidity, though both metrics remain higher compared to pre-pandemic levels.
