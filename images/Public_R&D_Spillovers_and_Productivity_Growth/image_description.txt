The image depicts two graphs illustrating trends in Research & Development (R&D) funding in the United States and their correlation with Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth over time. Below is a summary of each graph and their combined significance:

**Graph (A): R&D expenditure by type of funder (1950-2020)**
- This line graph shows R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP, categorized by five different funding sources: Total, Private, Federal, Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and Universities.
- Key observations:
  - Total R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP has seen a general upward trend, peaking near 3.3% around 2020.
  - Private sector R&D spending has notably increased since 1980, becoming the largest contributor by 2020.
  - Federal R&D funding saw a significant rise till the mid-1960s but later stabilized around 0.6-1% of GDP.
  - Funding from NGOs and universities has remained minor, steadying around the 0% to 0.2% range.

**Graph (B): Aggregate TFP growth (1950-2020)**
- This bar chart with an overlaid dashed line represents the five-year average of TFP growth, along with Federal R&D expenditure as a percentage of GDP.
- Key observations:
  - TFP growth exhibited several fluctuations, peaking high in the late 1950s and experiencing another significant rise during the 1990s.
  - The growth rates tend to stabilize around 1% in recent decades.
  - A notable observation is that increases in R&D expenditures, particularly federal funding, are followed by periods of higher TFP growth, suggesting a correlation between R&D investment and productivity gains.

**Combined Significance:**
- The overall trend suggests that increased investments in R&D, particularly from private sectors, correlate with periods of substantial TFP growth.
- The long-term data indicates that strategic efforts in R&D investments by both public and private sectors could potentially lead to enhancements in productivity and, consequently, economic growth.

**Notes:**
- The data sources include the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics, combining historical data from the National Science Foundation.
- TFP growth rates, sourced from Bergeaud et al. (2016), are averaged over five-year bins to smooth short-term fluctuations and highlight underlying trends.

This comprehensive analysis underscores the importance of diversified and sustained R&D investments in driving innovation and economic productivity in the US.
