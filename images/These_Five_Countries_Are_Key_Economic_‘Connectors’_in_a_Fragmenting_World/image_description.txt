The image is a scatter plot titled "Picking Winners: How We Found Our Five," which illustrates an analysis by Bloomberg Economics using UN Comtrade & UNCTAD World Investment Report data. The plot shows the relationship between changes in manufacturing export performance and changes in share of global greenfield investment (2013-2022 relative to 2003-2012). 

Key elements of the plot are:

1. **Axes**:
   - The horizontal axis represents "Change in manufacturing export performance," measured relative to the global trend since 2017.
   - The vertical axis represents "Change in share of global greenfield investment," ranging from -80% to 80%.

2. **Data Points**:
   - Yellow dots represent "Connectors," while black dots represent "Others."

3. **Highlighted Countries**:
   - Five countries (labeled Connectors) are highlighted with yellow dots: Mexico, Poland, Morocco, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

4. **Performance**:
   - **Mexico**: Shows a relatively high increase in both manufacturing export performance and share of global greenfield investment.
   - **Poland**: Shows a modest increase in both metrics.
   - **Morocco and Indonesia**: Show moderate changes in both metrics.
   - **Vietnam**: Shows the highest increase in manufacturing export performance among the highlighted countries, with a notable increase in the share of global greenfield investment.
