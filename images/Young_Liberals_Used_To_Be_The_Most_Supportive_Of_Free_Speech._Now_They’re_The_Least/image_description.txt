The chart illustrates U.S. adults' support for the free speech rights of individuals with racist views, segmented by political ideology (Conservative and Liberal) and birth year. The data is sourced from the General Social Survey and spans from 1974 to 2022.

Key insights include:

1. **Trend Over Time:** 
   - Both conservative and liberal support for free speech rights of those with racist views generally increases and peaks for people born in the mid-20th century.
   - A decline is evident for individuals born around the 1980s and onward, with support sharply dropping for both groups in more recent birth years (post-1989).

2. **Political Ideology Comparison:**
   - Early on, conservatives (red line) and liberals (blue line) displayed similar levels of support.
   - Over time, particularly around the mid-20th century, a noticeable gap develops, with liberals generally showing greater support than conservatives.
   - By the late 20th and early 21st centuries, support declines considerably for both ideologies, converging again as birth years approach the 2000s.

3. **Peak Support:**
   - The highest support for both conservatives and liberals is for those born in the 1940s, with liberal support slightly leading.
   - Conservatives peak around slightly earlier birth years compared to liberals.

In summary, support for free speech rights of individuals with racist views has varied over the generations, with notable peaks among mid-20th-century birth cohorts and significant reductions among more recent generations, cutting across political ideologies.
