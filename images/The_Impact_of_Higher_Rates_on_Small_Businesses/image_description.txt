The image, titled "Exhibit 8: The Private Sector as a Whole Can Finance Its Own Spending and Investmentâ€”Unlike in 2000 and 2006," presents a graph displaying the private sector financial balance as a percentage of GDP from 1977 to 2021. The graph contrasts the "Top-Down" official measure from GDP accounts with data on "Core: Households + Corporates + Small Businesses + (GDP - GDI)," excluding banks, inventory investment, and corporate acquisitions. A 12-quarter moving average is also plotted for both series.

Key points:

1. **Historical Context**:
   - The graph includes notable historical economic events such as the Tech Bubble (2000) and Housing & Credit Bubbles (2007).
   - Grey shading indicates periods of recessions based on NBER (National Bureau of Economic Research) recession indicators.

2. **Trends and Observations**:
   - The financial balance peaked and dropped significantly during the Tech Bubble and Housing & Credit Bubbles.
   - Post-2008 financial crisis, the private sector has demonstrated fluctuations but generally recovered up until a dramatic peak around 2020, likely reflecting the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the economy.

3. **Recent Behavior**:
   - The graph indicates that unlike in 2000 and 2006, the private sector has recently shown the capacity to finance its own spending and investment, reaching a high positive financial balance around 2020.

4. **Notable Shifts**:
   - There is a significant spike in the private sector's financial balance around 2020, potentially due to pandemic-related economic measures and shifts in spending.

5. **Source Information**:
   - The data is sourced from the Department of Commerce, Federal Reserve, and Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, ensuring a comprehensive analysis based on reliable financial measures.

The graph's conclusion points to a resilient private sector that, unlike during the 2000 and 2006 bubbles, can support its spending and investments without excessive reliance on external financing.
