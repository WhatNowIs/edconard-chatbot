The exhibit "Forms of Increasing Returns" provides an overview of various concepts related to increasing returns, listing key figures associated with each idea, a brief explanation of the idea, and its relevance in economic and business contexts.

1. **Economies of Scale**
   - **People:** Adam Smith, Alfred Marshall, John Stuart Mill
   - **Key Idea:** A company can perform essential tasks at a lower cost per unit as volume increases.
   - **Relevance:** Enables one company to gain scale at the expense of competitors, potentially leading to monopolies.

2. **International Trade**
   - **People:** David Ricardo, Paul Krugman
   - **Key Idea:** Firms can create many products that are differentiated and achieve economies of scale through trade.
   - **Relevance:** Merges comparative advantage with monopolistic competition to explain increasing returns.

3. **Learning by Doing**
   - **People:** Ken Arrow, Paul Romer, Robert Lucas Jr., T.P. Wright
   - **Key Idea:** Cost per unit drops by about 20% for every doubling of cumulative output.
   - **Relevance:** Companies can achieve cost advantages by producing higher cumulative output than competitors.

4. **Positive Feedback and Network Effects**
   - **People:** W. Brian Arthur, Paul David, Carl Shapiro
   - **Key Idea:** Positive feedback can enable one product to dominate others, locking in customers. Network effects increase the value of a product or service as more people use it.
   - **Relevance:** Leads to outcomes where the winners take all, enhancing increasing returns, especially when combined with economies of scale and network effects.

5. **Recombination of Ideas**
   - **People:** Paul Romer, Robert Solow, John Holland
   - **Key Idea:** Innovation arises from recombining ideas to transform inputs into greater outputs.
   - **Relevance:** Ideas are building blocks for innovation; manipulating them computationally can drive faster growth and increasing returns. Some ideas can be "partially excludable," allowing companies to profit.
