The graph displays data from the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers on the current value of stock market investments among the population over time. It shows two key trends: the percentage of the population with stock market investments worth $500,000 or more (green line) and those with investments worth under $10,000 (blue line).

Key points include:

1. **Record High**: As of the latest data, 30% of the population has a stock market portfolio valued at over $500,000, which is an all-time high.
2. **Trend Over Time**: Since January 1998, the green and blue lines depict fluctuating levels of high-net-worth investments.
   - The value of $500,000+ stock investments shows a significant increase, especially noticeable since around 2013.
   - Conversely, the percentage of those with stock investments under $10,000 has stayed relatively stable, showing minor fluctuations.
3. **Major Economic Events**: Highlighted periods of economic downturn, such as the recessions around 2001 and 2008, correspond to changes in investment values. A dip can be observed in the value of larger portfolios during these times.
4. **Fed Rate Hikes**: The period starting around early 2022 marked by "Fed starts hiking" — referring to interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve — coincides with continued growth in high-value portfolios.

In summary, there's a clear increasing trend in the proportion of the population holding substantial stock market portfolios ($500,000+), with a significant peak in recent years, despite temporary declines during economic downturns. The percentage of smaller portfolios under $10,000 has remained relatively unchanged by comparison.
