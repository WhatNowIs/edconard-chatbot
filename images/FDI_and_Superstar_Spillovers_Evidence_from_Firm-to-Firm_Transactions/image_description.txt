Figure 1: Gains from Selling to Multinationals

**Summary:**
The figure consists of six scatter plots, each illustrating different metrics that show the impact of firms in Belgium starting to sell to multinationals (MNEs). The horizontal axis in each plot represents the years before and after the firm begins selling to an MNE (with t = 1 indicating the treatment year and t = 5 aggregating all the years greater than or equal to four years after treatment). Each data point reflects the coefficient comparing treated firms to untreated firms, alongside 95% confidence intervals. The analyses control for industry-year and firm fixed effects, with standard errors clustered at the firm level.

**Panels:**
1. **(a) Log Total Factor Productivity (TFP):**
   - No significant impact from selling to multinationals.
   - Sample Size (N): 532,790; Treated Share: 23%.

2. **(b) Log Total Sales:**
   - Indications of an upward trend in total sales after selling to multinationals.
   - Sample Size (N): 509,712; Treated Share: 23%.

3. **(c) Log Other Sales:**
   - Upward trend in sales not to MNEs is observed several years after treatment.
   - Sample Size (N): 509,146; Treated Share: 23%.

4. **(d) Log Intermediate Inputs:**
   - No significant impact on intermediate inputs from selling to multinationals.
   - Sample Size (N): 510,198; Treated Share: 23%.

5. **(e) Log Wage Bill:**
   - No notable change in wage bills, except for minor upticks years after treatment.
   - Sample Size (N): 531,188; Treated Share: 23%.

6. **(f) Log Number of Other Buyers:**
   - Significant increase in the number of other buyers after firms start selling to multinationals.
   - Sample Size (N): 397,129; Treated Share: 24%.

**Notes:**
- Selling to an MNE is defined as having at least 10% inward or outward foreign ownership.
- All regressions adjust for industry-specific and yearly variations.
- The study leverages different dependent variables: TFP, total sales, other sales, intermediate inputs, wage bill, and number of other buyers to understand the comprehensive effects of firms' integration with multinationals.
