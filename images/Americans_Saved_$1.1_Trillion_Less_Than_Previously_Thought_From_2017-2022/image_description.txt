The image is a bar chart titled "Americans Saved Less Than Thought," with data sourced from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The chart displays two sets of data for each year from 2017 to 2022: "Previously published" and "Revised" savings rates, measured in trillion dollars ($T).

Key observations include:

- **2017**: Previously published savings were higher than the revised rates, around 0.5 trillion dollars for previously published and slightly lower for revised.
- **2018**: Similar trend with previously published savings higher than revised, both below 0.5 trillion dollars.
- **2019**: Published savings were under 1 trillion dollars, but revised data show a lower value.
- **2020**: Both values increased significantly, with published savings close to 3 trillion dollars and revised just below 3 trillion dollars.
- **2021**: Savings dropped compared to 2020 but were still elevated. Previously published savings were around 2.5 trillion dollars, while revised savings were just below 2 trillion dollars.
- **2022**: Savings declined considerably, with previously published values just above 0.5 trillion dollars and revised rates below 0.5 trillion dollars.

Overall, the BEA update indicates that the savings rate was consistently lower than previously thought over the examined period.
