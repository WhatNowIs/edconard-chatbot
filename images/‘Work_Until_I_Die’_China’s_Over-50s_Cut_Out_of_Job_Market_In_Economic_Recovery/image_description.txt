The provided chart from the Financial Times, based on data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China and FT calculations, illustrates the highest educational attainment by different age groups in 2020.

The age groups are segmented into: 60s, 50s, 40s, 30s, and 20s. The educational levels are categorized as follows:
- None (light pink)
- Primary (6-12 years old) (dark pink)
- Junior secondary (12-15 years old) (red)
- Senior secondary (15-18 years old) (light blue)
- Tertiary (18+ years old) (dark blue)

Key observations include:
1. **Older Generations (Ages 60s and 50s)**: A significant portion of the older generation has a lower level of educational attainment, with many only achieving primary or junior secondary education. Particularly, the 60s group shows minimal senior secondary and tertiary education.
2. **Middle Age Group (40s)**: This age group shows an improvement with a larger proportion achieving junior secondary and senior secondary education. However, tertiary education is still relatively low compared to younger groups.
3. **Younger Generations (Ages 30s and 20s)**: These groups show a considerable increase in higher educational attainment. The 30s have a good distribution among senior secondary and tertiary education, while the 20s have the highest levels of tertiary education among all groups.

In summary, the chart highlights a significant educational gap between older and younger generations, with younger individuals attaining higher levels of education.
