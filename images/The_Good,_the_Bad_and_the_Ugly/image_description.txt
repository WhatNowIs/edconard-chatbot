Key details:
- The y-axis represents power demand in gigawatts, ranging from 18 to 42 GW.
- The x-axis spans from the year 2019 to 2039.
- Five different forecasts are depicted:
  - PJM 2023 (black dashed line)
  - PJM 2022 (red line)

This is notably higher than previous forecasts. PJM 2022 predicts a more moderate increase, hitting approximately 30 GW by 2039. Past forecasts (PJM 2020, PJM 2019, and PJM 2021) forecast lower demands, with PJM 2019 and PJM 2021 predicting minimal increases up to around 20-23 GW by the same year. Comparing these forecasts highlights a growing trend and revised expectations for higher future power demand by Dominion Resources.
