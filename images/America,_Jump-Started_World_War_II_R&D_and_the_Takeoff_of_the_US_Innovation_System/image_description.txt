The image titled "Figure 1: Government-funded share of U.S. patents, 1920 to 2000" shows a bar graph that plots the share of U.S. patents funded by the government annually, from the year 1920 to 2000. The vertical axis represents the government-funded share of patents, ranging from 0.00 to 0.12. The horizontal axis represents the filing years from 1920 to 2000.

Key insights from the graph include:

- There is a notable increase in government-funded patents starting around 1940, reaching a peak intensity during World War II.
- Post World War II, the share of government-funded patents starts to decline but remains relatively high until around 1970.
- After the 1970s, there is a noticeable and steady decline in the share of government-funded patents, continuing through to 2000.

The notes below the graph indicate that this data is derived from administrative records and highlight World War II as the period with the peak intensity of government-funded inventions in U.S. history. Further details about the data can be found in the appendix.
