The image is a graph titled "Global Factors Drive Growth in U.S. Import Prices after COVID-19 until Mid-2022." It illustrates the 4-quarter (4Q) log change in U.S. import prices from 2018 to early 2023. The data is categorized into four components:

1. **Global** (blue bars)
2. **Idiosyncratic China supply** (green bars)
3. **Idiosyncratic U.S. demand** (red bars)
4. **Idiosyncratic non-China supply** (light green bars)

Additionally, the graph includes a black line that represents the overall 4Q log change in the import price index.

**Key Observations:**

- **2018 to 2019**: Import prices showed fluctuating changes with positive influences from global factors and negative influences from idiosyncratic China supply early on.
- **2019 to 2020**: The changes in import prices remained relatively stable with small fluctuations.
- **2020**: Prices experienced a dip, largely influenced by global factors and idiosyncratic U.S. demand.
- **2021**: Import prices saw a notable increase with significant contributions from global factors.
- **Mid-2022**: Continued positive contributions from global factors, though beginning to decline towards the latter part of the year.
- **2023**: A noticeable decline in the import price index, influenced by the reduction in global factor contributions and negative influences from idiosyncratic China and non-China supply.
