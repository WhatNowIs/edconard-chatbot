The image illustrates the US current account as a percentage of GDP from approximately 1970 to 2022. The data is shown as a 4-quarter moving average (4qma). The components of the current account are divided into non-commodity goods, services, commodities, and others.

Key points:
1. **Trend Overview**: The US current account has generally shown a deficit (negative values) over the span of several decades.
2. **Components**:
   - **Non-Commodity Goods** (blue): The largest component, typically contributing to a significant portion of the current account deficit.
   - **Services** (gray): Has a relatively stable contribution, sometimes positive, thus offsetting deficits slightly.
   - **Commodities** (orange): Contribute to the deficit or surplus modestly.
   - **Others** (yellow): The smallest share but noticeable.
3. **Critical Periods**:
   - From 1980 to mid-1980s and early 1990s, the deficit fluctuated, but remained less severe.
   - From early 2000s to around 2006, the deficit deepened significantly reaching below -6%.
   - The deficit peaked in Q2-2022 at -4.1%.
   - In Q1-2020, the deficit was -2.0%, showing some improvement but has worsened again after.
   - By Q1-2024, the deficit is projected to be -3.3%, indicating a slight improvement from its most recent peak.
  
In summary, the US current account has been predominantly in deficit over the past 50 years, driven significantly by non-commodity goods. Services generally provide a balancing effect, contributing to a lesser extent in recent years. The data records substantial fluctuations, with notable deficits during certain periods, followed by slight recoveries. The forecast for Q1-2024 suggests a moderate improvement from recent lows.
