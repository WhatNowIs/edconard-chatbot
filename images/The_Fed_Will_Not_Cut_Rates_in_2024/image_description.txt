The provided image demonstrates multiple measures of inflation from January 2018 to October 2023, highlighting a rising trend in inflation over time. The graph tracks the following:

1. Core Services CPI (in blue)
2. Atlanta Fed Sticky CPI (in orange)
3. FRB Cleveland Trimmed-Mean CPI (in gray)
4. FRB Cleveland Median CPI (in beige)

Key insights:

1. **Broad Pattern (2018-2023)**:
    - All inflation measures remained relatively stable and low from January 2018 up until early 2020.
  
2. **Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic (2020)**:
    - There is a distinct dip in all measures around March 2020, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is highlighted by a shaded vertical area in the graph.

3. **Post-pandemic Recovery (2020-2023)**:
    - Following the initial drop, there has been a consistent uptick in inflation, with multiple fluctuations indicating volatility but an overall upward trend.
    - From mid-2021 onwards, the measures show increased spikes, indicating rising inflationary pressure.

4. **2023 Inflation Trend**:
    - The data for 2023 shows a significant increase, especially towards the end of the year, where all measures dramatically rise to around 0.6-0.7%.

In summary, the graph illustrates that inflation has been steadily increasing, especially in the aftermath of the initial COVID-19 economic disruptions, with a notable rise in 2023. This suggests that inflationary pressures are intensifying, as evidenced by the convergence of the different measures around higher values in more recent months.
