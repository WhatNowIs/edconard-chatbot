The provided image features two graphs (Figure 1) that illustrate the percentage of adult children living with their parents in the U.S. from 1960 to 2020. The data is sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau Decennial Censuses (1960-1980) and the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplements (1990-2020).

### Summary:
**Figure 1: Adult Children Living in the Parental Home, 1960-2020**

**Panel (a): Adult Children Ages 18-34, by Sex**
- **Trend:**
  - General increase in the percentage of 18-34-year-olds living at home over time.
- **By Sex:**
  - Men (red dashed line): Consistently higher percentage of living at home compared to women.
  - Women (blue dashed line): Lower percentage but follows a similar increasing trend.
  - Overall (black line): The combined percentage of both sexes shows a rising trend from around 22% in 1960 to about 31% in 2020.

**Panel (b): Adult Children, by Age**
- **Trend:**
  - Both age groups (18-24 and 25-34) show an increasing trend in living at home over time.
- **By Age:**
  - 18-24 Year Olds (red dashed line): The percentage rose from roughly 45% in 1960 to over 50% in 2020.
  - 25-34 Year Olds (blue dashed line): Lower than the younger age group but increased from about 8% in 1960 to more than 15% in 2020.

**Conclusion:**
- The share of co-resident adult children in the U.S. has been increasing since the 1960s, with men and the younger age group (18-24-year-olds) more likely to live at home. The trend signifies changing economic, social, or cultural factors influencing living arrangements over the past six decades.
