The image is a bar chart depicting the average probability of moving in the next three years by current mortgage rate among mortgage borrowers. The data is sourced from the 2023 and 2024 SCE Housing Surveys, with black bars representing 95 percent confidence intervals.

**Key points from the chart:**

1. **Overall Comparison:**
   - When considering all mortgage borrowers:
     - The baseline probability of moving is about 15%.
     - The probability of moving if the current mortgage rate is kept is around 25%.

2. **Mortgage Rates Impact:**
   - Borrowers with a mortgage rate of less than 3%:
     - Baseline probability of moving is roughly 14%.
     - Probability increases significantly to around 30% if keeping the current rate.
   
   - Borrowers with a mortgage rate between 3% to 4%:
     - Baseline probability is around 15%.
     - Keeping the mortgage rate increases the probability to about 28%.
   
   - Borrowers with a mortgage rate higher than 4%:
     - Baseline probability is also about 15%.
     - Keeping the current rate increases this to approximately 23%.

**Summary:**
The chart illustrates that the likelihood of mortgage borrowers moving within the next three years is influenced by their current mortgage rate. The probability of moving increases significantly if borrowers can keep their current mortgage rate, especially for those with rates under 4%. This suggests that retaining favorable mortgage conditions is a strong incentive for homeowners to consider relocating.
