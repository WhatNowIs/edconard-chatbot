The image illustrates the future outcome expectations among U.S. 12th graders from various generations, namely Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z, as per data compiled and analyzed by Jean M. Twenge from 'Generations' (expectations) and Pew Research Center (generations).

### Summary of Key Findings:

1. **Expectation of Graduate or Professional Degree:**
   - In the early 1980s, around 35.7% of students expected to attain a graduate or professional degree.
   - This expectation saw a rise and reached around 56.9% around the early 2000s.
   - However, by 2022, the expectation decreased to 46.8%.

2. **Expectation of a Professional Job:**
   - Starting at approximately 56.1% in the late 1970s, the expectation of getting a professional job significantly rose to 69.2% in the early 2000s.
   - By 2022, this expectation dropped to 52.1%.

3. **Expectation to Own More than Parents:**
   - Initially, about 53.5% of 12th graders in the late 1970s believed they would own more than their parents.
   - This optimism rose, peaking at 62.0% around the early 2000s.
   - However, this expectation declined to 54.6% by 2022.

### Trend Analysis:
- There is a noticeable increase in positive expectations regarding educational attainment, professional employment, and personal wealth from the late 1970s to early 2000s.
- Expectations have generally decreased from their peaks in the early 2000s to 2022 across all three categories.
- Gen Z shows generally lower expectations in all the evaluated categories compared to previous generations.

### Conclusion:
The data suggest an initial growth in optimism among 12th graders concerning their future outcomes, followed by a notable decrease by 2022, reflecting potential changes in socio-economic conditions, educational insights, and broader societal expectations.
