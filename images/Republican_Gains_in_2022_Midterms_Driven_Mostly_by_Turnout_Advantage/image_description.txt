The image, provided by the Pew Research Center, presents analysis on voter turnout and party loyalty during the 2020 and 2022 U.S. elections:

1. **Turnout Advantage in 2022 Midterms**:
   - Among individuals who voted in the 2020 presidential election, 67% of those who voted for Joe Biden turned out to vote in the 2022 midterm elections.
   - In comparison, 71% of those who voted for Donald Trump in 2020 voted in the 2022 midterm elections.
   - This data indicates a higher turnout among Trump voters compared to Biden voters in the 2022 midterms.

2. **Partisan Loyalty between 2020 and 2022**:
   - 97% of individuals who voted for Trump in 2020 voted for a Republican House candidate in the 2022 midterms. Only 3% voted for a different party.
   - 93% of Biden 2020 voters voted for a Democratic House candidate in the 2022 midterms, while 7% voted for a different party.
   - This highlights that Trump voters exhibited slightly higher partisan loyalty compared to Biden voters in these elections.

3. **Notes**: 
   - The data comes from a survey of 7,041 adult citizens, complemented by official state election records and panelist profile surveys. The surveys were conducted shortly after the respective elections in 2020 and 2022.

The findings suggest that the Republicans had a slight advantage in voter turnout and greater party loyalty among their base in the 2022 midterm elections.
