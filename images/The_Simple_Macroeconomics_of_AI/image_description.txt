The provided image portrays Figure 1 titled "Distribution of AI Exposure across the Wage Distribution." It presents a scatter plot aimed at depicting the feasible exposure to AI across various demographic groups, measured in percentages. Key axes include:

- **Horizontal Axis**: Hourly wage in 2018-2022, represented on a logarithmic scale in 2020 dollars, ranging approximately from $10 to over $75.
- **Vertical Axis**: Feasible AI exposure percentage, ranging from 0 to 8%.

The legend clarifies that:
- The colors represent different education levels:
  - Green: Less than high school
  - Pink: High school
  - Purple: Some college
  - Blue: College
  - Yellow: Postgraduate
  
- The size of the markers is proportional to the average 2018-2022 employment level of each group.

**Key Observations**:
1. **Educational Attainment and AI Exposure**:
    - Individuals with less than a high school education (green) and high school education (pink) exhibit considerable variability in AI exposure, predominantly concentrated at lower wage levels.
    - Those with some college education (purple) show prominent exposure levels at intermediate wage levels.
    - College graduates and postgraduates (blue and yellow) tend to cluster towards higher wage groups with varying degrees of AI exposure.

2. **Wage Distribution**:
    - AI exposure seems to be distributed across all wage levels, with noticeable clusters at different education levels.
    - Higher wage groups (>$31.6) demonstrate more significant representation from college and postgraduate demographics (blue and yellow).

3. **Employment Level**:
    - Larger markers signify demographic groups with higher average employment over the specified period, indicating areas of more substantial workforce presence.

Summarily, the figure captures the intersection of AI exposure with wage distribution across educationally stratified demographic groups, stressing employment and earnings variability related to AI engagement.
