The image presents a conceptual framework for understanding how supply and relative demand shocks affect prices, wages, and inflation. It is structured into three columns, each demonstrating different scenarios of how supply and demand shocks can operate over time:

1. **Left Column:**
   - **Graph 1:** Shows a fluctuating pattern (back-and-forth movement) between the prices of TVs, oil, and goods (red line) compared to wages and services (green line).
   - **Graph 2:** Depicts steady inflation with no significant changes over time.

2. **Middle Column:**
   - **Graph 1:** Illustrates an increasing trend for the prices of TVs, oil, and goods (red line) and a relatively stable rise in wages and services (green line).
   - **Graph 2:** Displays inflation that steadily increases over time.

3. **Right Column:**
   - **Graph 1:** Represents an aggressive initial increase in the prices of TVs, oil, and goods (red line), followed by a more moderate rise, while wages and services (green line) increase steadily, but less sharply.
   - **Graph 2:** Shows an accelerating inflation rate over time, initially rapid, then stabilizing at a higher level.

The bottom of the image provides key points:
   - **Supply and relative demand shocks are relative price shocks.**
   - **To cause inflation, these shocks must be accommodated.**
   - **All models where "supply shocks cause inflation" incorporate adjustments in the money supply, interest rate, or fiscal accommodation.**

An image of a donkey pulling a cart tied to a carrot with a stick symbolizes the idea that policy choices (monetary/fiscal) are crucial in determining the inflationary outcome.
