The line graph titled "The Taxpayers Coming, Going and Staying in New York State" displays the average adjusted gross income (AGI) of three groups: Comers (blue line), Goers (black line), and Stayers (gray line) over the time period from 2011/12 to 2020/21. 

Key points from the graph:
1. **Comers**: The average AGI of individuals moving to New York State has steadily increased, starting from around $70K in 2011/12 and reaching just above $80K in 2020/21.
2. **Goers**: The AGI for individuals leaving the state has grown significantly over the same period. Starting at around $75K in 2011/12, it saw a substantial spike after 2017/18, reaching approximately $130K in 2020/21.
3. **Stayers**: The income of those who have remained in New York State saw a moderate increase from about $75K in 2011/12 to around $85K in 2017/18, stabilizing close to $85K towards 2020/21.

The source of the data is the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 

Overall, the graph indicates that while the AGI of stayers and comers has increased modestly over the last decade, the AGI of goers has sharply increased, particularly after 2017/18, indicating that higher-income individuals are increasingly leaving New York State.
