The image consists of two charts, labeled as Figure 4, titled "Personal Saving Rate and Household Income and Consumption." These charts come from data provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), with additional analysis from The Hamilton Project and Brookings.

### Chart A: Personal Saving Rate, 1960–2023
- **Y-axis:** Personal saving rate (percentage of disposable personal income, DPI)
- **X-axis:** Years ranging from 1960 to 2023
- **Data Trend:** 
  - The personal saving rate fluctuated substantially over time, reaching peaks in the early 1970s and during the COVID-19 pandemic around 2020-2021.
  - The rate was generally between 10-15% until the mid-1980s when it began a slow decline, dipping below 5% at times.
  - Post-2020, a significant spike occurred, reflecting a dramatic increase in saving rates during the pandemic, followed by a sharp decline, bringing the rate back down closer to historical lows by 2023.
- **Recession Shading:** Gray bars indicate periods of recession.

### Chart B: Household Income and Consumption, November 2019–May 2023
- **Y-axis:** Measured in 2022 dollars (trillions)
- **X-axis:** Monthly from November 2019 to May 2023
- **Data Trends:**
  - **Real Disposable Income:** Displayed with a solid green line, shows substantial volatility, particularly peaking around April 2020 during the pandemic and then gradually stabilizing.
  - **Real Disposable Income Trendline:** Dashed green line indicating the pre-pandemic trend for real disposable income slightly under the post-pandemic peaks but maintaining a consistent upward trend.
  - **Real Consumption:** Shown with a solid orange line, dropped significantly around April 2020 at the pandemic's onset but gradually recovered to align closer to the pre-pandemic trendline.
  - **Real Consumption Trendline:** Dashed orange line representing the consistent upward trend of real consumption before the pandemic's impact and after its recovery.

### Summary:

- **Personal Saving Rate:** The saving rate showed significant historical variances but notably spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, indicative of altered consumer behavior during economic uncertainty, followed by a return to lower levels comparable to historical norms by 2023.
- **Household Income and Consumption:** Both real disposable income and real consumption experienced significant disruptions due to the pandemic, with real disposable income peaking rapidly due to stimulus measures and real consumption compensating with a decline due to lockdowns and restrictions, eventually stabilizing back towards pre-pandemic trends by mid-2023. 

These charts provide a comprehensive visual of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on savings rates and household financial behavior, highlighting periods of uncertainty and recovery.
