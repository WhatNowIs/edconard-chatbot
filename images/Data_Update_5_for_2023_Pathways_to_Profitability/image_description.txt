   - The 75th percentile for US firms stands at 24.04%, indicating a substantial number of high-performing companies.

2. **Global Comparison:**
   - Regions like the EU and Environs and Small Asia show relatively high median ROIC values of 6.66% and 4.77%, respectively.
   - The lowest median ROIC is reported in Canada, with a value of -7.99%.
   - The highest median ROIC is in the Eastern Europe & Russia region at 4.96%.

3. **Performance Distribution:**
   - Globally, most firms fall within the 0%-2% ROIC range, but there are significant outliers with ROIC greater than 30%.
   - US firms show a wider spread in ROIC, significantly contributing to the higher ROIC percentages both on the lower and upper ends.

This shows that while global firms have a broad spread of returns, US firms generally exhibit a higher median return with more companies performing at very high ROIC levels.
