The chart titled "Chart 1: Wage Growth Tracker and CPI Inflation" illustrates the changes in wage growth and Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation from March 1998 to March 2022. The chart includes three percentiles for wage growth (25th, 50th, and 75th) and the CPI inflation rate. 

Key observations include:

1. **Wage Growth Tracker (50th Percentile)**: The wage growth for the median percentile shows relatively steady growth, with some fluctuations, particularly during economic downturns around 2008 and 2020.

2. **25th and 75th Percentiles**: The lowest (25th) and highest (75th) percentiles of wage growth depict more volatility compared to the median wage growth. Notably, the 25th percentile saw periods of negative growth, especially around 2002 and 2008.

3. **CPI Inflation**: CPI inflation exhibits more dramatic fluctuations, with significant peaks around 2008 and then a sharp rise from late 2020 to early 2022, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic period and subsequent economic recovery.

4. **Decoupling Trends**: Toward the end of the observed period, wage growth shows a general upward trend, but CPI inflation experiences a sharp increase, indicating rising living costs that could potentially outpace wage increases.

The data note emphasizes that the wage figures represent year-over-year changes and are shown quarterly, derived from the Current Population Survey and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The chart shows how wage growth and inflation have interacted over time, with recent years highlighting challenges in matching wage growth with rising inflation.
