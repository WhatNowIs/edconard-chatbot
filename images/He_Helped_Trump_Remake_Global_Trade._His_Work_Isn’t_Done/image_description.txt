The image is a line graph titled "Structural Imbalance" that illustrates the goods trade balance as a share of world GDP for China and the U.S. over time. 

Key observations from the graph:
- The time span covers the period from 2010 to around 2022.
- China's trade balance (represented by the red line) has been generally positive, moving from approximately 0.2% to around 0.7% of world GDP during this period, showing an overall upward trend, though with some fluctuations.
- The U.S. trade balance (represented by the blue line) remains negative throughout the entire period, fluctuating around -1.0% of world GDP, with a slight improvement near the end of the period depicted.

The source of the data includes CEIC Data, U.S. Commerce Department, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) calculations. The data is based on market prices and exchange rates. 

This graph effectively highlights the growing surplus in China's trade balance and the persistent trade deficit in the U.S. over the observed period.
