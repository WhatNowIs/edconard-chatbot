The image provides an analysis of treatment effects over time on various components of household balance sheets. The analysis is divided into four main graphs, each representing a different component:

1. **Net Worth (Figure a):** 
   - The x-axis represents different time periods (Baseline, Year 2, and Year 3).
   - The y-axis represents the total value of net worth.
   - Black dots indicate the control group mean over time.
   - Red dots show the estimated treatment effect plus the control group mean.
   - Net worth appears to increase over time in both control and treatment groups, with the treatment group showing a consistently higher increase.

2. **Real Assets (Figure b):**
   - The x-axis represents different time periods (Baseline, Year 2, and Year 3).
   - The y-axis represents the total value of real assets (which may include housing).
   - Both the control and treatment groups exhibit an increase in real assets over time, with treatment effects positively influencing the growth.

3. **Financial Assets (Figure c):**
   - The x-axis represents different time periods (Baseline, Year 2, and Year 3).
   - The y-axis represents the total value of financial assets, including savings, checking, and cash held.
   - There is a notable increase in financial assets over time, with the treatment group showing more significant growth compared to the control group.

4. **Debt (Figure d):**
   - The x-axis represents different time periods (Baseline, Year 2, and Year 3).
   - The y-axis represents the total value of participants' debt.
   - While both groups show an increase in debt, the treatment effect appears to slightly mitigate the overall increase in the treatment group's debt over time compared to the control group.

**Note:**
- Black dots are used for the control group, representing the control mean over time.
- Red dots combine the control mean with the estimated treatment effect for the given time periods.
- In study years 1, 2, and 3, estimates of the treatment effect using Equation 1 are presented.
- For the baseline period, the baseline value of the outcome was removed from the LASSO selected controls to avoid perfect predictions in the baseline period.
- 95% confidence intervals around the estimated treatment effect are shown in red.

**Summary:**
The provided figures comprehensively illustrate the positive effects of a certain treatment over time on households' net worth, real assets, and financial assets, while moderating the increase in household debt. The treatment improves financial standing and asset growth compared to the control group, signaling effective intervention.
