### Controls Explained

1. **Manager’s production skills:**
   - Consistently included across all columns with values between 0.198 to 0.215.
2. **Workers’ production skills:**
   - Also consistently incorporated, ranging from 0.238 to 0.263.
3. **Manager familiar with participants:**
   - Considered in Columns (2) through (6).
4. **Manager risk appetite:**
   - Included in Columns (4) through (6).
5. **Variance team production skills:**
   - Included in Columns (5) and (6).
6. **Granular production skills:**
   - Considered in Column (6).

### Counts

- **Groups [4 rounds per person]:** Around 700 groups consistently across columns.
- **Managers:** Ranging from 176 to 186.
- **Workers:** Ranging from 357 to 369.

### Summary

The table evaluates the effects of managers and workers on group performance under different control variables. It shows that the manager effect remains significant across all control settings, while the worker effect varies, with some significance noted under certain conditions. The inclusion of multiple controls provides robustness to the analysis. The counts of groups, managers, and workers involved are fairly consistent across different models.
