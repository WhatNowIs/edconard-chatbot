This image presents a comparative line graph depicting inflation rates over two distinct periods: 2020s and 1967-1985. The blue line represents the 2020s, while the orange line represents 1967-1985 (displayed on the right-hand scale).

Key observations:
1. **Inflation Rates in 2020s (Blue Line)**:
   - The graph starts in 2015 with values close to 0%.
   - From 2016 through 2019, the rates fluctuate moderately around the 2% mark.
   - A significant spike begins in 2021, peaking around mid-2022 at approximately 10%.
   - Post-peak, there is a noticeable decline, yet the rates stabilize above the 4% mark by early 2023.
  
2. **Inflation Rates in 1967-1985 (Orange Line)**:
   - The graph shows low inflation rates around 0% at the start in 1967.
   - Following a similar trend of moderate fluctuations initially, but by the early 1970s, the rates start rising steeply.
   - The most noteworthy spike occurs around the late 1970s and early 1980s, peaking at approximately 14%.
   - Post-peak, from the mid-1980s, inflation rates gradually decline, stabilizing between 4% and 6% towards the end of the period.

Summary:
The graph provides a comparative analysis of inflation trends from two significant historical periods. Both periods start with relatively low and stable inflation but experience sharp spikes due to economic factors. The trends show both periods returning to more stable, albeit higher than initial, rates after their peaks. The 2020s shows a quick spike and decline while the 1967-1985 period exhibits a longer, more sustained rise and fall in inflation rates.
