The image is a graph illustrating the trends in inflation expectations and their consistency with the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. 

### Key Elements:
1. **Title:** "Here's a Tip: Short Term Inflation Expectations are Consistent With The Fed's 2% Target"
2. **Graph Type:** Line chart
3. **Y-Axis:** TIPS Breakevens, %
4. **X-Axis:** Date range from 2018 to 2023
5. **Data Series:**
    - Yellow Line: 5 Year Inflation Breakevens.
    - Green Line: 5 Year, 5 Year Forward Inflation Breakevens.
6. **Shaded Area:** Represents breakevens approximately consistent with the 2% inflation target, between approximately 1.9% and 2.2%.

### Summary:
The graph tracks the 5 Year Inflation Breakevens and 5 Year, 5 Year Forward Inflation Breakevens from 2018 to 2023. Breakevens are indicators of market inflation expectations derived from TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities). 

- **2018 to Early 2020:** Both metrics were slightly below the 2% target, with visible fluctuations.
- **Early 2020:** There was a sharp decline in both lines, particularly in the 5-year breakevens, likely due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **Late 2020 to 2021:** A significant recovery occurred, with 5-year breakevens even surpassing the upper bound of the 2% target range.
- **2022:** There was increased volatility but trends generally hovered near or slightly above the 2% target.
- **2023:** Both metrics appear to return closer to the 2% target, indicating that short-term inflation expectations are aligning with the Fedâ€™s target.

### Conclusion:
The graph suggests that, despite periods of volatility and deviation, current short-term inflation expectations are now broadly consistent with the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
