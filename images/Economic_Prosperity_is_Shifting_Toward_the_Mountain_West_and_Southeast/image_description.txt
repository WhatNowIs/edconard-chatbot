The image titled "The changing map of economic prosperity and distress" by the Economic Innovation Group illustrates the percentage point change in the share of residents within prosperous zip codes across the United States between 2011-2015 and 2017-2021.

The map uses different shades of blue to indicate changes:
- Light blue represents a decrease in the prosperous zip code share (< -6 to -3%).
- Deeper shades of blue indicate larger increases in the prosperous zip code share (â‰¥ 3%).

Key observations:
- States like Nevada, North Dakota, and Delaware show significant increases in economic prosperity with changes of 6.7%, 20.1%, and 3.2%, respectively.
- Montana and Wyoming have shown decreases with -23.9% and -15% declines, indicating notable distress.
- Southern states such as North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida have demonstrated moderate prosperity with increases of 2.4%, 2.7%, and 6.1%, respectively.
- East Coast and Midwest regions show a mixed pattern of economic change, with some states like Massachusetts and Maine indicating slight positive changes and others like Illinois and Indiana showing declines.

Ultimately, the map provides a visual representation of how economic conditions have changed over the observed periods for different states, highlighting regions of both growing prosperity and economic distress.
