The graph titled "The Investment Crash" provides a comparative analysis of real personal consumption expenditures and real private fixed investment from 2000 to approximately 2023. The chart highlights a few key trends:

1. **Real Personal Consumption Expenditures (represented by the yellow line)**:
   - Generally fluctuates around a stable positive growth rate.
   - Experienced a substantial dip during the 2008 financial crisis.
   - Sharp decrease and subsequent quick rebound around 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. **Real Private Fixed Investment (represented by the teal line)**:
   - Shows more significant fluctuations compared to personal consumption.
   - Experienced a steep decline around the 2008 financial crisis, much sharper than in personal consumption.
   - Similarly, there was a sharp drop around 2020, followed by a brief peak, and then another steep decline. 

3. **Overall Trends**:
   - Consumption growth has generally been more stable but slowed over time.
   - Private investment shows higher volatility and has recently collapsed post-2020 rebound.

The graph underscores the growing disparity between the stability of consumption growth and the volatility of private investment over the past two decades.
