The image presents a line graph illustrating changes in the economic influence of wives within opposite-sex marriages from 1972 to 2022. It categorizes the percentage of marriages into three types based on earnings arrangements: 

1. **Husband primary or sole breadwinner**: The graph shows a significant decline in this category from 85% in 1972 to 55% in 2022.

2. **Egalitarian** (both spouses contributing equally): This category shows an increase from 11% in 1972 to 29% in 2022.

3. **Wife primary or sole breadwinner**: This category indicates a rise from 5% in 1972 to 16% in 2022.

Summary:
Over the past 50 years, there has been a notable shift in the economic dynamics of opposite-sex marriages. The percentage of husbands as the primary or sole earners has decreased significantly, while more marriages are becoming economically egalitarian or have the wife as the primary earner. This trend suggests that wives are gaining greater economic influence while also potentially managing a heavier burden at home.
