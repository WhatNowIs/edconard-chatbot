The image depicts a graph from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) that compares Gross Domestic Investment to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Net Domestic Investment to GDP in the United States from roughly 1947 to 2020. Here is a summary based on the graph:

1. **Gross Domestic Investment/GDP (Blue Line):**
   - This ratio fluctuates between approximately 0.15 and 0.28 from 1947 to 2020.
   - There are recurring peaks and troughs that seem to correspond with economic cycles.
   - Significant declines are noticeable around periods of economic downturns, such as the early 1980s recession, early 2000s recession, and the 2008 financial crisis.
   - Post-2008, the ratio recovers but doesn't return to previous highs.

2. **Net Domestic Investment/GDP (Red Line):**
   - This ratio is consistently lower than the Gross Domestic Investment/GDP ratio, reflecting depreciation of assets.
   - There are noticeable fluctuations, with peaks around 0.10 to 0.12 and troughs around 0.02 to 0.06.
   - Sharp declines are seen around the same periods of economic downturns, particular during the early 1980s, early 2000s, and 2008.
   - Post-2008, there is a significant drop, and the ratio remains lower than before.

3. **Shaded Areas:**
   - Grey shaded vertical bars represent recession periods in the U.S. economy.
   - During these periods, both investment ratios typically decline, indicating reduced economic activity and investment.

Overall, the image underscores the volatility in domestic investment relative to GDP, with significant impacts during recessions. The difference between gross and net investment highlights the importance of accounting for depreciation, with net investment being consistently lower. The recovery after recessions tends to be slow, especially noticeable after the most recent 2008 financial crisis.
