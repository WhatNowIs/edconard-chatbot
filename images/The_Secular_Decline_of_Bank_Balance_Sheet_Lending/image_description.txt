This figure, titled "Figure 1: Total Lending to Households and Non-Financial Businesses over Time and its Main Funding Channels," comprises three panels illustrating trends in lending from 1962 to 2022:

1. **Panel (a): Total Lending**
   - This panel shows the evolution of the outstanding volume of total lending to households and non-financial businesses. The graph illustrates a steady increase over time, with a significant rise beginning in the late 1990s, eventually reaching a total volume of over $40 trillion by 2022.

2. **Panel (b): Informationally Sensitive Lending**
   - This graph breaks down total lending into informationally sensitive loans, specifically bank balance sheet loans. Like the total lending graph, informationally sensitive lending shows a consistent upward trend, notably accelerating from the late 1990s onwards. The volume reaches around $15 trillion by 2022.

3. **Panel (c): Debt Securities**
   - The final panel represents the breakdown of total lending into debt securities, with the dashed line highlighting government-affiliated debt securities. The volume of total debt securities has seen substantial growth, especially after the mid-1990s, reaching around $25 trillion by 2022. Government-affiliated debt securities, indicated by the dashed line, also increase but remain below the total, highlighting their contribution to the overall volume.
