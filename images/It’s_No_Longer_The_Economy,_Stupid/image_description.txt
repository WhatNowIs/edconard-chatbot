### Summary:
Since 2002, the relationship between economic sentiment and government approval has weakened significantly in the US, while it remains positively correlated in France, Germany, and the UK. This suggests that unlike in many Western European countries, economic sentiment is no longer a strong predictor of government approval in the United States.
