The image presents a graph that tracks the relationship between the market value of corporate equities in the U.S. as a fraction of U.S. GDP and the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasuries over an extensive period from 1953 to 2023. 

### Key Elements:

1. **Value of Stock Market/GDP (Blue Line)**
   - This line represents the market value of corporate equities, expressed as a percentage of U.S. GDP. 
   - The trend shows fluctuations with a noticeable increase over time, peaking around the late 1990s and early 2000s and again around the 2020s.

2. **Long-term Interest Rate (Red Line)**
   - This line represents the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasuries.
   - It shows a significant increase during the late 1970s and early 1980s, reaching its highest point in the early 1980s, followed by a gradual decline until around 2010–2020, with a small recent uptick.

### Trends and Observations:
- The **value of the stock market relative to GDP** exhibits significant growth from around 50% in the 1950s to peaks exceeding 300% around the early 2000s and again around the 2020s.
- The **long-term interest rate** peaked at over 15% in the early 1980s but has since generally declined to around 2%–4% in recent years.
- The graph suggests a possible inverse relationship between the value of the stock market relative to GDP and the long-term interest rate, particularly evident during several periods.

### Source:
The data is sourced from the FRED of St. Louis Fed and J. Rangvid, encompassing quarterly data from 1953Q1 to 2023Q4.

### Summary:
This graph illustrates the historical fluctuations and relationship between the market value of corporate equities in the U.S. as a fraction of GDP and the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasuries over a 70-year period. It highlights substantial changes and peaks in the stock market valuation related to GDP during the dot-com bubble and the more recent period around 2020. Concurrently, it outlines the significant decline in long-term interest rates from their peak in the early 1980s to the present.
