This figure presents a visual analysis of historical and projected economic growth trends. The key points of the graph are as follows:

1. **Historic Trend Growth (blue line)**:
   - The graph depicts historical economic growth trends from 1961 to 2021, showing several fluctuations during this period.
   - The growth rate was higher in the 1960s and 1970s, with notable peaks around 1965 and 1978.
   - A decline in trend growth is observable in the early 1980s, followed by a brief rise towards the late 1990s.
   - Since the early 2000s, the historical growth trend has generally been on a downward trajectory, particularly noticeable after the 2008 financial crisis.

2. **Projected Potential Growth (red line)**:
   - This projection, provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), spans from 2023 to 2053 and is indicated by the shaded area on the graph.
   - Potential growth is projected to stabilize at a lower rate compared to the historical trends from past decades.

3. **Natural Rate of Interest (r\*, green line)**:
   - The natural rate of interest, estimated by the New York Fed, follows the potential natural growth trend closely until around 2017.
   - Post-2017, r\* indicates a trajectory of very low growth, suggesting prolonged periods of low-interest rates as a reflection of economic conditions.

4. **Overall Trends**:
   - Historical data illustrates periods of higher volatility in growth rates.
   - Future projections point towards consistently lower and relatively stable growth rates and interest rates.

The key insights from the chart reflect a transition from higher and more volatile historical growth to a projected period of steadier but subdued economic growth and interest rates for the upcoming three decades, according to estimates by the New York Fed and the CBO.
