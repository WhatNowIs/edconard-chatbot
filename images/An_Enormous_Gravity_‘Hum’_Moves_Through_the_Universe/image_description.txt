The infographic explains that astronomers use pulsars, which are dead stars emitting uniform pulses of energy, to detect ripples in space-time. Supermassive black holes orbiting each other create long, low-frequency gravitational waves, which distort space-time by squishing it in one direction and stretching it in the other. As these waves travel through the galaxy, they affect the timing of pulsar signals. By observing tiny variations in the pulsar signals' rhythm, astronomers can identify the presence of gravitational waves. This method essentially turns the galaxy into a detector for gravitational waves.
