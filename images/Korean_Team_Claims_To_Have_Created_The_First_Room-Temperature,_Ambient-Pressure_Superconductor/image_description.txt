This image provides a detailed summary of the preparation of vacuum crystal tubes with mixed powder and the various stages of heat treatment involved. Below is a summary based on the extracted information:

### Process Flow:

1. **Sealed Vacuum Crystal Tube (a):**
   - Mixed powder is sealed in a vacuum crystal tube under a vacuum of \( 10^{-3} \) mTorr.

2. **Heat Treatment Stages:**
   - **Stage 1 (b):**
     - Temperature: 725°C
     - Duration: 24 hours
     - Environment: In \( 10^{-3} \) Torr
     - Reaction: Lanarkite (\( \text{Pb}_3(\text{SO}_4)_2\text{O} \)) decomposes into \( \text{PbO} + \text{Pb(SO}_4\text{)} \).

   - **Stage 2 (c):**
     - Temperature: 550°C
     - Duration: 48 hours
     - Environment: In \( 10^{-3} \) Torr
     - Reaction: \( \text{Cu}_3\text{P} \) decomposes into \( \text{Cu} + \text{P} \).

   - **Stage 3 (d):**
     - Temperature: 925°C
     - Duration: 5-20 hours
     - Environment: In \( 10^{-3} \) Torr
     - Reaction: Formation of \( \text{Pb}_{10-x}\text{Cu}_x(\text{PO}_4)_6\text{O} \) from Lanarkite and \( \text{Cu}_3\text{P} \).
