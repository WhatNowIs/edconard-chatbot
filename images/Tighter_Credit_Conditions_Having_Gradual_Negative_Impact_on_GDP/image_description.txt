The image shows a graph depicting the response of real GDP growth to a one standard deviation shock to banks tightening Commercial & Industrial (C&I) loans to large firms over ten quarters. This analysis uses an Impulse Response Function (IRF) from the VAR model, involving variables such as Loan growth (YoY), GDP growth (YoY), and SLOOS tightening. 

Key Points:
1. **Initial Decline**: There is a significant decline in real GDP growth, reaching a trough after 6 quarters.
2. **Impact in 6 Quarters**: The decline bottoms out at -0.7 percentage points following a tightening shock in bank lending conditions.
3. **Recovery Phase**: After the low point at the 6th quarter, GDP growth begins to recover.
4. **Long-term Adjustment**: By the 10th quarter, the GDP growth shows signs of adjustment back towards zero, though still within the lower bound of the initial impact.
5. **Standard Deviation Impact**: The one standard deviation shock to bank tightening amounts to 10.2 percentage points in total loan tightening.
