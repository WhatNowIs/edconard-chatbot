The bar chart titled "Venture Investors Get Less Generous" depicts the U.S. venture capital deal activity broken down by quarter, measured in billions of dollars, from Q1 2021 to Q1 2023. 

Summary:
- Q1 2021 started with approximately $75 billion in venture capital deals.
- The deal activity remained fairly steady between $75 billion and $85 billion from Q1 2021 to Q3 2021.
- A notable increase occurred in Q4 2021, reaching close to $90 billion, followed by a peak of approximately $95 billion in Q1 2022.
- Post-Q1 2022, there was a significant decrease in venture capital activity. Q2 2022 saw around $80 billion, then progressively declining to about $55 billion by Q4 2022.
- The trend continued downwards in Q1 2023, with the activity dropping to approximately $40 billion.

This data indicates a decline in venture capital deal activity over the observed period, especially sharp after Q1 2022. The observation suggests that venture investors have become less generous or more cautious in recent quarters.
