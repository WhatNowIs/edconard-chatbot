The chart, titled "Against the grain," provides a visual analysis of China's commodity imports and manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) over the period from 2011 to 2024. 

### Key Points:
- **Commodity Imports (% Change on a Year Earlier):**
  - There were significant fluctuations in commodity imports over the years.
  - Major drops are visible around 2015, 2018, and a substantial decline in 2019, which has been quantified at a 35.7% decrease.
  - After the sharp decline in 2019, there was an increase, but it fluctuated around the zero mark for the following years.

- **Manufacturing Purchasing Managersâ€™ Index (PMI):**
  - The PMI, which is represented by the red line, indicates the economic health of the manufacturing sector.
  - A PMI above 50 suggests expansion, while below 50 indicates contraction.
  - The index saw steady fluctuations just above and below the 50 mark early in the decade, peaking significantly around 2020-2021 above 56.
  - Post-peak, the PMI saw a steep decline but again neared stability around the 50 mark.

### Observations:
- The most significant disparity occurred around 2019, with commodity imports plummeting sharply while PMI showed much less volatility.
- There is a general trend of both metrics moving in relative synchronization, with both experiencing ups and downs at somewhat similar times but with varying magnitudes.
