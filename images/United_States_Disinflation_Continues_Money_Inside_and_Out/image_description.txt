### Summary of the Service CPI (% annualised) Data

This image showcases the trends of the Service CPI (Consumer Price Index) annualized in three different formats over time: Year-over-Year (YoY%), 3-Month Average (3MA%), and 1-Month Average (1MA%). 

#### Key Observations:

1. **YoY% (Year-over-Year)**:
   - The YoY% graph shows a steady increase in Service CPI, with a notable uptick starting around 2021.
   - The blue line (Services) peaked around 8% by the latter part of 2022, indicating a significant rise in service prices.
   - The green line (excluding OER, rent, medical services, and hotels and airfares) follows a similar trend but with slightly lower values, reflecting the diverse impact of different services on the general CPI.

2. **3MA% (3-Month Average)**:
   - There is considerable volatility in the 3MA% values, particularly between 2020 and 2022. 
   - The green line shows more dramatic fluctuations compared to the blue line.
   - Service CPI reached approximately 10% at several peaks between 2021 and 2022 before declining slightly toward the end of 2022.

3. **1MA% (1-Month Average)**:
   - The 1MA% demonstrates the highest volatility among the three graphs.
   - Significant spikes reaching above 10% are evident, particularly noticeable in 2021 and 2022.
   - Both the blue and green lines show substantial variability month-to-month, signifying short-term changes in prices.

### General Insights:

- **Inflation Trends:** There is a clear upward trend in service-related inflation from 2020 onwards, peaking in late 2022.
- **Volatility:** Short-term averages (1MA%) are much more volatile compared to longer-term averages (3MA%) and YoY%, indicating significant monthly fluctuations.
- **Different Service Categories Impact:** CPI calculations excluding OER, rent, medical services, and hotels and airfares reveal slightly lower but parallel inflation trends, suggesting that these excluded categories play a considerable role in overall service price inflation.

This data is crucial for understanding inflation trends in the service sector, aiding in economic planning and policy-making.
