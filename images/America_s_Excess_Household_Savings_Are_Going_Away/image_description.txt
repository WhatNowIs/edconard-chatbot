The chart examines the deviation between actual liquid asset holdings and the trend from 2014-2019, broken down by household income groups. It shows data from 2014 through 2022, with the value represented in USD trillions:

1. **Top 1%** (dark blue)
2. **80-99%** (blue)
3. **Bottom 80%** (light blue)

**Key Observations:**

1. From 2014 to 2019, there were minor positive or negative deviations from the trend, without significant changes in liquid asset holdings for any income group.
   
2. Starting in 2020, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a substantial increase in liquid asset holdings, particularly among the top 1% and the 80-99% income groups. 

3. By 2022, the top 1%'s liquid asset holdings exceeded $3 trillion above the trend, while the 80-99% group surpassed $2 trillion above the trend. The bottom 80% had notable increases as well but in smaller amounts compared to the higher income groups.

4. A substantial portion of the increase in liquid assets in recent years is attributed to wealthier households (top 1% and 80-99%), who also appear to be the ones liquidating these excess savings.

**Conclusion:**

The data suggest that wealthier Americans have seen a significant rise in liquid asset holdings since 2020, far above historical trends. The increase is markedly less for the bottom 80% of households. This trend highlights the growing financial disparity and the concentration of financial liquidity among the wealthier segments of the population.
