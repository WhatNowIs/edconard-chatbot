The image is a bar chart illustrating the annual global average temperature anomaly (in degrees Celsius) from around 1970 to 2023, relative to the 1850-1900 reference level. The chart reveals a consistent increase in temperature anomalies over this period. Notably, 2023 stands out as the warmest year on record by a significant margin, with a temperature anomaly of 1.48Â°C above the pre-industrial level. This data underscores the accelerating trend of global warming. The source of the data is the C3S/ECMWF.
