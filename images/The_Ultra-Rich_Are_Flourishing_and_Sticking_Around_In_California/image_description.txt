The chart from the California Department of Finance illustrates the substantial growth in the number of wealthy taxpayers in California over the years, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The taxpayers are categorized into three wealth brackets: $1 million to $2 million, $2 million to $50 million, and greater than $50 million. Here is a brief summary:

1. **Steady Growth Pre-Pandemic**: From 2006 to 2018, there was a gradual increase in the number of millionaires in California. The categories consistently showed growth with the $2 million to $50 million group witnessing notable increases over the years.

2. **Sharp Increase During the Pandemic**: There was a striking surge in the number of wealthy taxpayers during the pandemic period (2019-2020). The number of people in all three wealth brackets saw significant growth, with the total count approaching 300,000 in 2020.

3. **Categorical Contributions**:
   - **$1 million to $2 million (Black)**: This category has shown consistent growth, though the increase is more noticeable post-2018.
   - **$2 million to $50 million (Pink)**: This segment has shown substantial growth, especially during the pandemic, contributing significantly to the total increase.
   - **Greater than $50 million (Yellow)**: This is the smallest group but its presence indicates a rise in ultra-wealthy taxpayers, particularly noticeable post-pandemic.

In summary, the pandemic period saw an unprecedented rise in the number of millionaires in California, reflecting significant economic shifts and possibly wealth concentration during these years.
