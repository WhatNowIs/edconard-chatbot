The chart from the Congressional Budget Office outlines the projected demographic outlook for the United States from 2024 to 2052, focusing on population growth drivers. The key indicators demonstrated include Population Growth, Births Minus Deaths, and Net Immigration.

### Key Insights:

1. **Population Growth**:
   - Represented by a black line, the overall trend for population growth is decreasing over the years 2024 to 2052.

2. **Births Minus Deaths**:
   - Shown in pink, this metric highlights the natural increase in population. However, this factor declines over the timeline and eventually turns negative around the 2040s, indicating more deaths than births by this point.

3. **Net Immigration**:
   - Illustrated in yellow, net immigration remains relatively stable and positive across the forecasted period. It becomes the primary contributor to population growth as the natural increase becomes negative.

4. **Projections**:
   - Initially, population growth is driven by both natural increases (births minus deaths) and net immigration.
   - Over time, as the natural increase diminishes and turns negative, net immigration becomes more significant and eventually the sole contributor to population growth.

### Summary:
The U.S. population growth from 2024 to 2052 is expected to slow significantly. While population growth is initially supported by both natural increases and net immigration, the gradually diminishing and eventually negative natural increase indicates a demographic shift. Moving forward, net immigration will be the primary driver of population growth, highlighting the increasing importance of immigration to sustain demographic stability in the U.S. This trend underscores the critical role of immigration policy to manage future population dynamics effectively.
