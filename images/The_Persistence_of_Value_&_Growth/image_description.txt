The chart titled "Figure 1: Persistence of 'Expensive' Valuations in the US" tracks the percentage distribution across different quartile movements of stock valuations from 1996 to 2020. Here's a breakdown:

- **Q4 -> Q4** (most expensive quartile remaining the most expensive): Represented in dark blue. The percentage fluctuates, starting at 46% in 1996, and tending to stay mostly above 50% in recent years, reaching 53% in 2020.
  
- **Q4 -> Q3**: Represented in teal. This shows the percentage of the most expensive quartile moving to the third expensive. The figures generally range between 20% to 36%, with a notable increase in 2002 (71%) and a minor peak in 2010 (22%).
  
- **Q4 -> Q2**: Represented in light blue. It ranges typically from 0% to 34%, with a notable spike in 2004 (17%). Recent years show a consistent pattern around 31% to 36%.
  
- **Q4 -> Q1** (most expensive moving to the cheapest): Represented in yellow, usually the smallest percentage. It remains relatively low, ranging from 0% to single digits, except in 2006, where it reached 34%. 

Overall, stocks in the US that start in the expensive quartile (Q4) predominantly stay in the same quartile or drop to Q3, with a very small percentage moving to Q1 over the studied period. This indicates a relative persistence in expensive stock valuations.
