The image consists of two related graphs titled "Figure 1: Corporate Profits as Percentage of GDP." Both graphs span the years from 1955 to 2020.

### Left Graph: Total Corporate Profits as Percentage of GDP
- **Description:** This graph shows the total corporate profits as a percentage of GDP over time, alongside the decade average.
- **Trends:**
  - From 1955 to the early 1980s, corporate profits as a percentage of GDP show significant variability, with peaks around the mid-1960s and dips in the early 1980s.
  - After the early 1980s, there is an overall upward trend, reaching new peaks in the mid-2000s and again around 2020.
  - The decade averages (red line) indicate a gradual increase over the decades, stabilizing at a higher level from the 2000s onwards.

### Right Graph: Domestic vs. Foreign Corporate Profits as Percentage of GDP
- **Description:** This graph differentiates between domestic and foreign corporate profits as percentages of GDP.
- **Trends:**
  - **Domestic:** There is a decline in domestic corporate profits as a percentage of GDP from the mid-1960s until the early 1980s, followed by variability and a general upward trend since the early 2000s.
  - **Foreign:** Foreign corporate profits start very low and display a steady increase over time, particularly from the mid-1980s onwards. By 2020, foreign profits have stabilized at a higher level.

### Summary:
From 1955 to 2020, total corporate profits as a percentage of GDP have generally increased, particularly since the early 2000s. This increase is driven by both domestic and, more significantly, foreign corporate profits. The domestic share shows a recovery and upward trend since the early 2000s while foreign profits have shown a steady growth trend since the mid-1980s. This indicates a shift in the global distribution of corporate profits, highlighting the growing importance of foreign earnings for corporations over the latter part of the period.
