The image provides a comprehensive view of labor productivity and labor market dynamics across different regions, including the Euro Area, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, from 2019 Q4 to 2023 Q4. It is divided into three main panels, each focusing on a different aspect.

**Left Panel: Contribution to Cumulative GDP Growth**
- This panel shows bar charts reflecting the contributions of various factors to GDP growth: Output per hour, hours per employee, and employment.
- In the Euro Area, GDP growth is marginal with a slight contribution from output per hour and a negative contribution from hours per employee.
- Canada shows modest GDP growth primarily driven by employment and hours per employee.
- The United States exhibits significant GDP growth, largely influenced by employment and hours per employee. The combination contributes to a notable GDP increase of around 8.2 percentage points.

**Middle Panel: Civilian Unemployment Rate**
- Line graphs depict the unemployment rates as a percentage of the labor force for Canada, the Euro Area, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
- From 2005 to early 2020, the unemployment rates fluctuate, showing peaks during the global financial crisis in 2008 and a significant spike around 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Post-2020, the unemployment rates decline as economies recover, with the United States and Canada showing a sharp reduction, while the Euro Area and the United Kingdom experience a more gradual decline.

**Right Panel: Sectoral Reallocation Index**
- The sectoral reallocation index, calculated using year-over-year growth rates of employment from SIC industry classification, is represented for the Euro Area and the United States.
- The index trends show relatively stable patterns from 2005 until 2020, where there is a notable spike, reflecting sectoral shifts during the pandemic.
- Post-2020, the index indicates a normalization towards pre-pandemic levels.

**Summary:**
Overall, the image illustrates how different regions have contributed to cumulative GDP growth through output per hour, hours per employee, and employment over the past few years. It highlights significant fluctuations in unemployment rates due to the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, with varied recovery paths across regions. Additionally, the sectoral reallocation index captures the shifts in employment growth rates, especially during the pandemic, suggesting significant economic adjustments.
