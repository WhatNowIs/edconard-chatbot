The image provides a world map indicating the distribution and size of global lithium resources, categorized by types. The lithium resource types are coded by color: 
- Blue for evaporative brine
- Red for hard rock
- Green for volcanic sedimentary
- Yellow for other types

The relative sizes of the lithium resources are represented by circle sizes: 
- n/a (not available)
- < 0.1 million tonnes (MT) of lithium metal
- <1.0 MT
- <3.0 MT
- >3.0 MT

Several significant lithium resource locations are identified and labeled on the map:
- Thacker Pass, USA
- Rhyolite Ridge, USA
- Hector, USA
- Sonora, USA
- Clayton Valley, USA
- Kings Mountain, USA
- S. American salars, South America (notable areas in Chile and Argentina)
- Jadar, Serbia
- Manono-Kitolo, Democratic Republic of the Congo
- Qaidam, China
- Greenbushes, Australia

According to the map and its accompanying text, current lithium production primarily comes from spodumene found in pegmatites in Australia (47%), brines from salt flats in Chile (30%), China (12%), and Argentina (5%).

In summary, the image provides a comprehensive overview of the global distribution, size, and types of lithium resources, highlighting key locations and current predominant production areas.
