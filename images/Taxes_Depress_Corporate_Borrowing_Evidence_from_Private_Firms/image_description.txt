The provided image contains two panels that illustrate tax coefficients for small private firms over event time periods from -2 to +4. The graphs show a series of tax coefficients measured at different event times.

### Panel A: Small Private Firms, Long-term Leverage
- The y-axis represents the tax coefficient.
- The x-axis represents event time, which ranges from -2 to +4.
- Red points and error bars indicate the estimated tax coefficients and their confidence intervals.
- The general trend of the tax coefficients appears to fluctuate around zero, without a clear upward or downward trend over time.
- Most of the error bars cross the zero-line, suggesting that many of the estimates are not statistically different from zero.

### Panel B: Small Private Firms, All Leverage
- Similar to Panel A, the y-axis represents the tax coefficient while the x-axis represents event time from -2 to +4.
- The red points and error bars indicate the estimated tax coefficients and their confidence intervals.
- Similar to Panel A, there is fluctuation around the zero line, and the error bars mostly cross the zero line, suggesting that the estimates might not be statistically different from zero.

### Summary
Both panels analyze tax coefficients for small private firms over various event times. Panel A focuses on long-term leverage, whereas Panel B considers all leverage. In both cases, the tax coefficients show variations around the zero line, with confidence intervals that often cross zero. This indicates that the estimates of the tax coefficients are typically not statistically significant, suggesting no definitive impact of the event on the tax coefficients for these firms over the observed period.
