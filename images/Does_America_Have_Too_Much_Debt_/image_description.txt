The chart displays the historical trends of the Federal Funds Effective Rate (right axis, in percent) and the Federal Debt relative to Nominal Potential Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (left axis, scaled by 0.1 million dollars) from approximately 2002 to 2023.

### Key Observations:

1. **Federal Funds Effective Rate (Red Line):**
   - Around 2002-2004: The rate was relatively high, peaking over 6%.
   - 2004-2008: A sharp increase, peaking again around 5%.
   - 2008-2015: A significant decline following the financial crisis, hitting near-zero levels and remaining low.
   - 2015-2019: Gradual increases, reaching about 2-2.5%.
   - 2020: Dropped dramatically to near-zero levels responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - 2022-2023: A sharp increase again, rising above 4%.

2. **Federal Debt Relative to GDP (Blue Line):**
   - 2002-2008: Moderate increase, from around 55 to 65.
   - 2008-2010: Sharp increase during the financial crisis, reaching around 80.
   - 2010-2019: Continued to rise steadily, reaching around 110.
   - 2020: Sharp increase to around 125 due to COVID-19 pandemic-related spending.
   - 2021-2023: Slightly stabilize but remains high, around 120.

### Summary:
The dataset illustrates the close relationship between federal monetary policy (interest rates) and federal debt relative to GDP. Major economic events such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted both the Federal Funds Rate and the Federal Debt. The Federal Funds Rate saw major declines during these crises, coupled with sharp increases in federal debt levels. More recently, as the economy recovers, the Federal Funds Rate has been increasing sharply again, whereas federal debt remains at elevated levels.
