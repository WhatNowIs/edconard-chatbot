The image is a line graph titled "Inflation is poised to drop below wage growth." The graph depicts the 12-month percent change in wages and prices from 2004 to a forecast for 2024.

Key takeaways:
- **Wages (red line)**: Display fluctuations over the period, generally staying between 2% and 4% growth until 2020, after which they increase significantly, reaching around 6% growth by 2022, before declining in the forecast period to previous levels.
- **Prices (blue line)**: Show more volatility, dropping significantly around 2008-2009 (indicating deflation), and generally remaining below wage growth until about 2021, when they spike to around 6%. Prices are forecasted to drop below wage growth again by 2023-2024.

The graph uses data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Bureau of Economic Analysis, Federal Reserve Economic Data, and authors' calculations. 

The notes specify that wages are measured by the employment cost index (ECI) for all private workers, and prices are measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index.
