The image displays a graph comparing various forecasts of China's GDP as a percentage of America's GDP over time, extending from the year 2000 up to approximately 2060. The forecasts are attributed to different sources:
- Goldman Sachs (2011 and 2022)
- OECD (2021)
- Capital Economics (2023)

Key points include:
1. **Goldman Sachs, 2011 Forecast**: Predicted that China's GDP would surpass 100% of America's GDP by around 2026 and rise to approximately 150% by 2035.
2. **OECD, 2021 Forecast**: Anticipated China’s GDP reaching parity with America by around 2030 and then increasing to about 125% by 2040.
3. **Goldman Sachs, 2022 Forecast**: Revised its prediction, suggesting that China’s GDP will achieve parity with the US around 2035, but the growth trajectory post-2035 shows a much slower increase compared to the 2011 forecast.
4. **Capital Economics, 2023 Forecast**: Indicates that China's GDP as a percentage of America's GDP will rise modestly, maintaining below 75% even past 2060 and showing a declining trend after around 2040.

This summary illustrates how various economic forecasts have changed over time, reflecting differing expectations about China's economic growth relative to the United States.
