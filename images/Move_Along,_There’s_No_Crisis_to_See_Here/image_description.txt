The provided image is a Bloomberg Opinion chart showing the TED Spread over time from 2007 to 2023. The TED Spread measures the difference between the interest rates on interbank loans and short-term U.S. government debt, indicating the perceived credit risk in the banking sector.

Key observations from the chart:

1. **Sharp Peaks**: There were significant spikes in the TED Spread around the 2007-2009 financial crisis, indicating high stress and perceived risk in the banking sector during this period.
2. **Reduction Post-Crisis**: After 2009, the TED Spread dramatically drops and stabilizes at much lower levels, suggesting reduced stress and improved confidence among banks.
3. **Minor Fluctuations**: There have been minor increases in the TED Spread post-2010, notably in years close to 2020, but these are relatively small compared to the 2007-2009 period.
4. **Current State**: As of 2023, the TED Spread remains low, indicating that, as yet, there is little stress perceived in the U.S. banking sector.

The overall summary indicates that, despite some fluctuations, there are no significant signs of distress in interbank lending currently.
