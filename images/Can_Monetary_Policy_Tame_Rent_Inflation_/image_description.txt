The bar chart titled "Rising contribution of rent inflation to services inflation" illustrates the contribution of rent (in blue) and other components (in green) to PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) services inflation, which is represented by a yellow line over the period from Q1 2021 to Q3 2022.

Key points:
1. **Overall Trend in PCE Services Inflation:** 
   - The yellow line (PCE services inflation) shows a general upward trend from 2% in Q1 2021, peaking at slightly above 4% by Q4 2021, and maintaining a steady level around 4.5% through Q3 2022.
   
2. **Contribution of Rent:**
   - The contribution of rent to services inflation has steadily increased throughout the period, starting from a small portion in Q1 2021 and rising consistently, showing a notable increase by Q3 2022.
   
3. **Other Components:**
   - While there is some variability, the contribution of other components (in green) predominantly remains stable through the period, even though it also contributes significantly to the overall services inflation.

The chart effectively highlights the growing impact of rent inflation on the overall services inflation over the period from Q1 2021 to Q3 2022.
