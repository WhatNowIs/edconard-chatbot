The image is a stacked area chart showing the share of global manufacturing output distributed among three categories over time from the year 2000 to 2020. The categories are:

1. **China** (represented in red)
2. **Developed markets** (represented in dark gray)
3. **Emerging markets excluding China** (represented in light gray)

Key points summarized from the chart:

- In 2000, China accounted for a small fraction of global manufacturing output.
- Over the years, China's share of global manufacturing output increased significantly, reaching close to or above 20% by 2020.
- Developed markets' share of global manufacturing output has gradually declined but still constitutes a substantial portion, around 40%-60% throughout the time period.
- The share of emerging markets excluding China has remained relatively stable, slightly above the 20% mark.

Overall, the chart highlights China's significant and increasing role in global manufacturing output over the two decades, with developed markets seeing a relative decline in their share, and emerging markets excluding China maintaining a consistent share.
