The image is a world map illustrating the observed types of avian flu since October 2022. The types of avian flu are represented by different colored markers:

- **Blue (H5)**
- **Pink (H5N1)**
- **Light Blue (H5N2)**
- **Light Green (H5N4)**

Key observations include:

1. **H5N1 (Pink)** is the most widely observed strain globally, particularly concentrated in North America, Europe, East Asia, and parts of South America.
2. **H5 (Blue)** has been specifically noted in South America, particularly along the western coastline.
3. **H5N2 (Light Blue)** occurrences are sparse, with few instances in locations such as Japan and some regions in North America.
4. **H5N4 (Light Green)** sightings are minimal, with only a handful of observations mainly in East Asia.

The data is sourced from FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) and the World Bank boundaries. The map is published by the Financial Times. This visual representation helps in understanding the global distribution of avian flu types and highlights regions with higher incidences, providing valuable insights for public health monitoring and response efforts.
