This chart titled "Chinese trade in manufactures as a share of China's GDP" tracks two key metrics from Q4 1996 to Q1 2022:

1. **Non-processing Manufactured Imports** (red line)
2. **Manufactured Exports Net of Processing** (blue line)

### Summary:

**Non-processing Manufactured Imports (Red Line):**
- From Q4 1996 to around Q1 2003: Increased from approximately 4% to a peak near 7%.
- From Q1 2003 to Q4 2021: There was a gradual and consistent decline, stabilizing around 3%-4%.

**Manufactured Exports Net of Processing (Blue Line):**
- From Q4 1996 to Q4 2007: Significant rise from around 8% to a peak above 18% by Q4 2007.
- From Q1 2008 to around Q4 2018: Declined to approximately 13%-14%.
- From Q1 2019 to Q4 2021: A mild upward trend, reaching close to 15%.

### Key Insights:
1. **Peak Periods:**
   - Manufactured export activity peaked around 2007-2008, influenced likely by China's increasing integration into the global economy and perhaps specific economic policies favoring export growth.
   - Non-processing imports peaked earlier, around 2003, before a prolonged decline, which could suggest shifts in domestic production capabilities or changes in import policies.

2. **Trends and Changes:**
   - Exports remained significantly higher than imports throughout the period, indicating a strong manufacturing export sector relative to GDP.
   - Despite a decline post-2008, the export share began to increase again in recent years, showcasing a potential rebound or stabilization in the manufacturing export sector.
   - Imports have shown a consistent decrease after the early 2000s, indicating possibly a shift towards more self-sufficient domestic production or changing global trade dynamics.

Overall, China's economy has consistently shown strong export activity in the manufacturing sector, with a noticeable but steady reduction in non-processing manufactured imports.
