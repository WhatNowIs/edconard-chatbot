The image presents a chart titled "Weak Case for Cuts" which illustrates breakeven inflation rates over different periods. These rates denote inflation expectations and show the following trends from 2011 to 2023:

- **Next 5 years:** Represented by the darkest line, it depicts fluctuations with peaks around 3.0% and sharp declines below 1.0%, indicating volatility in near-term inflation expectations.
- **5 years, 5 years from now:** Represented by the lightest line, this shows a narrower range of fluctuations, hovering between 1.5% and 3.0%, suggesting moderate long-term inflation expectations.
- **20 years, one decade from now:** Represented by the medium dark line, this also stays mostly within the range of 1.5% to 3.0%, but with slightly less volatility than the next 5 years line.

Key insights:
- Despite economic disruptions from the pandemic and war, traders have consistently bet on inflation returning to the Federal Reserve's desired level within a few years.
- Since October 2022, the chart indicates no significant improvement in the inflation outlook that would justify rate cuts.
- Short-term expectations exhibit more volatility compared to medium and long-term expectations, which are more stable but still exhibit some fluctuation.
