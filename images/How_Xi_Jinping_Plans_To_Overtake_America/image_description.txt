The image is a chart titled "A lot of moonshots" from The Economist, illustrating the sources of science and technology funding in China for the year 2020. The amounts are represented in trillion yuan. The sources are categorized into commercial, research and development tax incentives, government grants, and government off-budget financing.

Here are the key points summarized:

1. **Companies**:
   - Around 1.8 trillion yuan was funded from commercial sources (including foreign).
   - An additional approximately 0.5 trillion yuan came from research and development tax incentives.

2. **Research and Development Institutes**:
   - Received about 0.5 trillion yuan from government grants.
   - A significant portion also came from government off-budget financing but the exact figure is not provided.

3. **Universities**:
   - Funded by less than 0.5 trillion yuan from both commercial sources and government grants.
   - A modest amount from government off-budget financing is also noted.

4. **New Infrastructure**:
   - Investment here came majorly from government off-budget financing, nearing approximately 0.5 trillion yuan.

5. **Other Science and Technology Spending**:
   - This category saw a mix of funding from government grants and off-budget financing but is less dominant compared to other categories.

In summary, companies are the largest recipients of science and technology funding in China, with substantial contributions from commercial sources and tax incentives. Government grants and off-budget financing play a significant role in supporting research institutes, universities, and new infrastructure.
