The image presents a historical view of illegal immigration through the Southwest border of the United States. The data is shown as a percentage of the U.S. population from 1960 to approximately 2023. The chart includes three key data points:

1. **Southwest Border Encounters (Blue bars):** These represent the recorded number of encounters at the southwest border.
2. **Successful Unlawful Entries Assuming 40% Apprehension Rate (Black bars):** This assumes that border enforcement successfully apprehends 40% of unlawful entries.
3. **Estimated Successful Unlawful Entries (Gray bars):** These are estimates of the number of successful unlawful entries calculated using DHS estimates from 2000-2021 and other data sources for 2022-2023.

Key observations from the data include:
- There has been significant fluctuation in illegal border crossings over the decades.
- The 1980s saw a peak, with the highest incidents of encounters and estimated unlawful entries.
- Post-2000, a relative decrease is observed until the years leading to 2020.
- From 2020 onwards, there is a noticeable increase in both encounters and estimated unlawful entries.

Sources for the data include the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the U.S. Census Bureau, and calculations by the Cato Institute. This longitudinal data helps illustrate the trends and potential cyclical nature of illegal immigration over more than six decades.
