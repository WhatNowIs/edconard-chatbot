The chart titled "The Great Migration" illustrates the trends in U.S. bank deposits from Q1 2013 to Q4 2022, measured in USD trillions. 

### Key Insights:
1. **Migration of Deposits in 2022:**
   - In 2022 alone, about $800 billion of uninsured deposits exited the banking system.
   - The primary reason for this outflow is the higher interest rates offered by money-market mutual funds backed by U.S. federal government obligations.

2. **Bank CFO Decisions:**
   - Bank Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) consider it unattractive to offer competitive rates for deposits under the prevailing economic conditions.

3. **Deposit Trends:**
   - The data divides the bank deposits into two categories:
     - **Estimated insured deposits**: Represented in darker blue.
     - **Uninsured domestic deposits (implied)**: Represented in lighter blue.
   - There has been a steady increase in both types of deposits from 2013 to 2022.
   - By 2022, the total deposits accumulated to nearly $9 trillion.

### Trends Over Time:
- From 2013 to 2019, the growth in deposits was gradual.
- The period from 2020 shows a significant acceleration in the accumulation of deposits.
- Despite the overall upward trend, the gap between insured and uninsured deposits widened notably.
