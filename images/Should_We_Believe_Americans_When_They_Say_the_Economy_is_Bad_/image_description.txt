The image presents a comparative analysis of consumer confidence indices between actual levels and expected levels based on economic indicators for the US, France, Germany, and the UK from 2010 to around 2022.

### Key Points:

1. **Headline**: There is a significant divergence between how Americans perceive the economy and its actual performance.

2. **US**:
   - A noticeable gap has developed post-2020 where actual consumer confidence (red line) is substantially lower than expected levels (blue line).
   - The period around 2022 shows the most significant discrepancy, indicating that Americans feel worse about the economy than economic indicators suggest they should.

3. **France**:
   - The actual and expected confidence indices largely align over the years, with minor variations.
   - Post-2020, France's consumer confidence shows less disparity than the US, with actual levels closely following the expected trends.

4. **Germany**:
   - Up until around 2020, Germanyâ€™s actual and expected confidence levels track fairly closely.
   - However, a marked divergence similar to the US appears post-2020, showing actual consumer confidence significantly lagging behind expected levels.

5. **UK**:
   - The UK also shows a fairly consistent match between actual and expected confidence up until around 2020.
   - Post-2020, a visible gap forms, though it is not as pronounced as that seen in the US, indicating some misalignment between consumer perceptions and economic indicators.

6. **Data Sources**:
   - The chart data is derived from reputable sources including the OECD, Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, Nationwide, and national statistical offices.

### Summary:

This comparative study reveals a growing psychological-economic gap in consumer confidence in the US, where actual sentiment is significantly lower than what economic indicators would predict, especially post-2020. Similar but less pronounced trends are observed in Germany and the UK, while France shows minor discrepancies. This divergence could be due to a variety of factors including but not limited to economic policies, media influence, and social perceptions.
