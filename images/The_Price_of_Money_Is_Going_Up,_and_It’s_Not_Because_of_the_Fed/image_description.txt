The chart titled "Upside Risk to Natural Rate" forecasts the natural rate on 10-year U.S. government notes, adjusted for inflation, from 2022 to 2050. The chart includes four scenarios: 

- **Baseline forecast** (black bar)
- **Climate action** (blue bar)
- **Fiscal imprudence** (red bar)
- **Technological leap** (green bar)

Key observations from the chart:
1. **Baseline forecast (black)**: Dominates the natural rate throughout the entire period.
2. **Climate action (blue)**: Starts having a noticeable impact from around 2030 onwards but is consistently smaller compared to the other factors.
3. **Fiscal imprudence (red)**: Has a significant impact, especially from 2030 to 2048, contributing notably to the upside risk.
4. **Technological leap (green)**: Begins to have a significant impact around 2030, peaking around 2040, and then gradually diminishes.

Summary:
The chart illustrates that while the baseline forecast remains the major determinant of the natural rate of 10-year U.S. government notes, fiscal imprudence and technological leaps contribute significantly to the upside risk, especially from 2030 to 2050. Climate action has a smaller but visible impact starting from 2030. The natural rate peaks around 2040 and gradually declines towards 2050.
