The image provides significant insights into the increasing financial challenges and liabilities faced by state insurers in the U.S. due to natural disasters. Key points include:

1. Florida's state insurer faces potential losses of $525 billion, which is more than double the level recorded in January 2022 (Source: Citizens Property Insurance Corporation).
2. California's residual insurance plan has possible liabilities amounting to $290 billion, up sixfold from 2018 (Source: California FAIR Plan).
3. Out of 36 states that have residual insurance plans, 21 do not explicitly detail how they would cover deficits exceeding their assets (Source: Milliman).
4. The frequency of billion-dollar disasters in the United States has significantly increased. In the 1980s, there were roughly three such incidents annually, but the current annual occurrence is closer to 18 (Source: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration).

This data highlights the growing financial risks and the increasing importance of robust insurance and disaster response planning in the face of climate change and natural disasters.
