   - A relatively stable trend is observed from ages 18 to 74 with slight fluctuations.
   - The percentage of people reporting unhappiness and depression slightly increases with age.

2. **2021 Data (Blue Solid Line)**: 
   - This line shows much greater volatility compared to 2011.
   - In the early ages (18 to around 30), there is a notable spike reaching around 0.12, followed by sharp declines and subsequent peaks.
   - Between ages 30 to 65, the percentage generally trends downward but with numerous sharp peaks and troughs.
   - After age 65, the percentage remains lower than 2011 statistics but still fluctuates noticeably.

3. **Comparison**: 
   - In 2021, younger age groups (18-30) reported higher percentages of unhappiness and depression compared to 2011.
   - For individuals older than 60, the 2021 percentages are consistently lower than in 2011.
