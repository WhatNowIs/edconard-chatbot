This chart presents data on the performance of two different methods, labeled as "Conventional" (blue line) and "Instantaneous" (red line), over a one-year period from December 2021 (Dec21) to December 2022 (Dec22). 

Key observations:

1. **Performance Trends**:
   - The performance for both methods starts relatively close together in December 2021, around the value of 8.
   - The "Instantaneous" method shows a sharp rise and fluctuations, peaking to the highest value around 16 in mid-2022 before experiencing a steady decline.
   - The "Conventional" method shows a more stable and gradual increase initially, peaking around 12 in mid-2022, but then also demonstrates a gradual decline towards the end of 2022.

2. **Comparison**:
   - Throughout the period, the "Instantaneous" method consistently exhibits higher values than the "Conventional" method until mid-2022. After mid-2022, both methods show a decrease, but the "Instantaneous" method declines more steeply.
   - By December 2022, the "Instantaneous" method shows a sharper decline, approaching the zero mark, whereas the "Conventional" method maintains a higher residual value around 4.

3. **Data Points**:
   - Black dots (â€¢) scattered across the plots might represent actual data points or observations. They generally follow the trends of both the lines but sometimes show outlier behavior.

4. **Baseline and Differences**:
   - There's a dashed horizontal line across the chart which might serve as a baseline for performance comparison.

**Summary**:
Over the one-year period from December 2021 to December 2022, the "Instantaneous" method initially outperforms the "Conventional" method but begins to sharply decline after mid-2022. Conversely, the "Conventional" method shows a steadier, more gradual performance trajectory, ending the period with a higher residual performance compared to the "Instantaneous" method.
