The provided image is a line graph depicting the Real Gross Domestic Product (RGDP) per capita over a period of approximately 70 years for four entities: China, Japan, Korea, and the China, Taiwan Region. The graph uses a logarithmic scale (Log) for RGDP per capita and is normalized at China's GDP per capita in 1995.

Here is a summary of the graph:

- The X-axis represents the years, while the Y-axis represents the Log of RGDP per capita.
- The lines for each country or region represent how their RGDP per capita has evolved over the designated time period.
- Initially, around year 0, all regions start from similar levels.
- Over time, RGDP per capita increases for all regions; however, the growth rates and trajectories differ.
- Japan (orange line) shows a sharp increase initially and then stabilizes at a higher log RGDP per capita.
- Korea (yellow line) also exhibits rapid growth and continues to rise significantly.
- The China, Taiwan Region (purple line) demonstrates consistent growth, with some fluctuations but maintaining an upward trend.
- China (blue line) also shows substantial growth but slightly lags behind others initially before catching up over time.

Overall, the graph illustrates the economic progression of the selected East Asian countries and regions, highlighting both similarities and differences in their economic growth trajectories.
