The graph displays the inflation rates (annual percentage changes in consumer price indices) in Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) from January 2013 to March 2024.

Key observations:

1. **Frequently Low Inflation (2013-2020)**: Most Nordic countries experienced relatively stable and low inflation rates, generally between 0% and 3%.

2. **Iceland's High Volatility (2013-2020)**: Iceland had more volatile inflation, often higher than other Nordic countries, peaking near 6% around 2014–2015.

3. **Significant Increase (2021-2022)**: There was a marked rise in inflation across all countries starting in 2021, peaking in 2022. This period saw inflation rates reaching:
   - Iceland: Close to 12%.
   - Sweden, Finland, and Norway: Between 10% and 11%.
   - Denmark: Approximately 8%.

4. **Recent Decline (2023-2024)**: In 2023, inflation rates began to decrease in all countries, moving closer to 4–6%.

5. **Forecasted Trends (Early 2024)**: By early 2024, the decreasing trend in inflation is expected to continue for most Nordic countries.

Overall, the Nordic countries experienced a period of relatively low inflation before a sharp increase in the early 2020s, followed by a more recent decline. The driving factors behind these trends could include global economic conditions and regional economic policies.
