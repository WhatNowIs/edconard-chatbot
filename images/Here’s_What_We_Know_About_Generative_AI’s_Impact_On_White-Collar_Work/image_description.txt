  - Performance increase: 43% boost.
- **Top-half skilled participants**:
  - Score without ChatGPT: Approximately 5.7.
  - Score with ChatGPT: Approximately 6.7.
  - Performance increase: 17% boost.

### Impact of Encouragement to Use ChatGPT on Professional Writing Tasks
- **Tasks**: Included writing press releases, reports, analysis plans, and delicate emails.
- **Performance Boost**:
  - Lowest-skilled participants show a more significant performance boost when encouraged to use ChatGPT compared to the control group.
  - The performance boost diminishes as the skill level increases, with the highest-skilled participants benefiting less.

### Conclusion
Generative AI, especially ChatGPT, significantly levels the playing field by boosting the performance of less-skilled workers more than highly-skilled workers in high-skilled white-collar occupations. Encouraging the use of ChatGPT leads to improved performance across various professional writing tasks.
