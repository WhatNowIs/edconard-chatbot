The image contains three graphs illustrating trends in wage growth, real wages, and firm profits around periods of inflation peaks. Here's a detailed summary of each panel presented in the image:

### **Panel A: Purchasing Power of Households**
- **Title:** "Purchasing power of households has been eroded"
- **Content:** This bar chart showcases annual wage growth, comparing nominal and real wage changes between two periods: 2020-2022 (represented by bars) and 2008-2019 (represented by diamonds).
  - **Countries/Regions Assessed:** US, Euro Area (EA), Japan (JP), Other Advanced Economies (AEs), and Emerging Market Economies (EMEs).
  - **Key Findings:**
    - In all regions, nominal wage growth (red bars and diamonds) in 2020-22 generally surpasses that of 2008-19.
    - Real wage growth (blue bars and diamonds), however, is negative or significantly lower than nominal wage growth for 2020-22, indicating an erosion of household purchasing power during that period.

### **Panel B: Real Wages**
- **Title:** "Real wages have fallen behind more than they did in the past"
- **Content:** This line graph plots the trajectory of real wages around inflation peaks, comparing historical data (red lines and areas) with data from 2022-2023 (blue lines and areas).
  - **Y-Axis:** Percentage change in real wages.
  - **X-Axis:** Months around the inflation peak.
  - **Key Findings:**
    - Real wages in 2022-2023 (solid blue line) dropped significantly, more than the historical median (solid red line), and remained below 0% indicating substantial real wage erosion.
    - The shaded areas represent interquartile ranges, indicating a wider fluctuation in real wage changes in 2022-2023 compared to historical trends.

### **Panel C: Firm Profits**
- **Title:** "Firm profits have grown at a solid pace"
- **Content:** This line graph indicates firm profit changes derived from the GDP deflator not explained by changes in unit labor costs.
  - **Y-Axis:** Percentage change in firm profits.
  - **X-Axis:** Months around the inflation peak.
  - **Key Findings:**
    - Firm profits in the 2022-2023 period (solid blue line and shaded area) show a significant increase and stay mostly positive.
    - Compared to historical trends (solid red line), the 2022-2023 period demonstrates an overall robust growth in firm profits.

### **General Insights:**
- **Wage Growth:** While nominal wages have risen, real wages have not kept pace with inflation, leading to decreased purchasing power for households across various regions.
- **Real Wages:** The fall in real wages is more pronounced in the recent period (2022-2023) compared to past inflationary periods.
- **Firm Profits:** Conversely, firm profits have grown substantially during the same recent period, indicating a disparity between the business sector's profitability and the households' economic wellbeing.
