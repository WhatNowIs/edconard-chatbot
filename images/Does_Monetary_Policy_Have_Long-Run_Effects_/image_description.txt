The figure titled "Real GDP response to unexpected policy rate changes" illustrates the impact of a 1% unexpected change in domestic short-term interest rates on real GDP over a period of 12 years. 

### Key Points:
- **Loosening Shock (blue line and shading):**
  - Following a loosening shock (an unexpected cut in the interest rate):
    - Initially, the real GDP increases slightly.
    - The maximum positive effect is observed around 4-5 years after the change.
    - The GDP response gradually diminishes but remains slightly positive over the 12-year horizon.
  - The shaded blue area represents the one-standard-error confidence bands, indicating the potential range of the response.

- **Tightening Shock (red line and shading):**
  - Following a tightening shock (an unexpected hike in the interest rate):
    - The real GDP initially decreases.
    - The maximum negative effect is significant and is observed around 3-4 years after the change.
    - The GDP response continues to be negative over the 12-year horizon, with the negative impact diminishing slightly over time.
  - The shaded red area represents the one-standard-error confidence bands around the average response.

### Note:
- The data sample spans from 1900 to 2015, excluding World War periods.
- The confidence bands reflect a measure of uncertainty in the estimates.
- For detailed estimation methodology, see Jord√†, Singh, and Taylor (2023).

### Summary:
The chart demonstrates that an unexpected decrease in interest rates (loosening shock) has a generally positive impact on real GDP, particularly noticeable within the 4-5 year period post-change, whereas an unexpected increase in interest rates (tightening shock) results in a considerable and prolonged negative impact on real GDP, especially notable within the first 3-4 years.
