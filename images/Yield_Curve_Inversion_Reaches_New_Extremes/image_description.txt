The image is a graph showing the difference between the 10-year Treasury yield and the 2-year Treasury yield from 1980 to 2020. This difference is often referred to as the yield spread. The y-axis represents the yield spread in percentage points, ranging from -3 to 4 percentage points. The x-axis represents the time span from 1980 to 2020.

Key Points:
1. The yield spread has experienced significant fluctuations over the past four decades.
2. The spread has entered negative territory several times, particularly during or preceding periods labeled as "RECESSION."
3. There were notable peaks in the early 1980s, mid-1990s, early 2000s, and the mid-2010s.
4. Recently, the spread has dipped below zero again, indicating a potential inversion, often considered a predictor of economic recession.

Summary:
The graph depicts the historical trends of the 10-year Treasury yield minus the 2-year Treasury yield from 1980 to 2020. The yield spread shows considerable variability, with periods of inversion (negative values) typically associated with economic recessions. The most recent trend indicates another potential inversion, which historically signals a possible upcoming recession.
