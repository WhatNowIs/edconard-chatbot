The image provides a graph depicting the share of China's manufacturing value-added by source from 1996 to 2022, highlighting the proportion of manufacturing dedicated to domestic demand versus exports.

### Key Points:
1. **Overall Trend**:
   - Around 55% of China's manufacturing output is currently for domestic demand.
   
2. **Historical Data (1996-2018)**:
   - In 1996, the share of manufacturing for domestic demand was approximately 70%, which steadily decreased, reaching a low around 2005 where it was overtaken by the share for exports.
   - From 2005 onwards, the share from domestic demand started to rise, surpassing the export share around 2010-2011.
   
3. **Recent and Future Estimates (2019-2022)**:
   - The share from domestic demand has been consistently higher than that from exports since the early 2010s.
   - Projected data shows the trend continuing with the domestic demand share stabilizing around 55%.

4. **Comparative Insights**:
   - The share of manufacturing value-added for exports saw a significant rise in the early 2000s, peaking around 2006-2007.
   - A sharp decline in export share occurred around 2008-2009, coinciding with the global financial crisis.
   - Post-2010, the export share has stabilized but remains lower than the domestic share.
