The image displays two line graphs comparing the energy price index and real GDP between Germany and the United States from 2014 to 2023, with 2015 indexed to 100 for both metrics.

### Summary:

**Figure 1: Energy Price Index and Real GDP in Germany vs the United States**

#### (a) Price Index for Energy:
- **Germany (solid line)**: The energy price index shows fluctuations with a significant rise starting around 2021, peaking in 2022, and declining slightly thereafter.
- **United States (dashed line)**: The energy price index has a similar pattern but with more pronounced peaks and drops. There is also a sharp increase starting around 2021, reaching a peak in 2022, followed by a decline.

#### (b) Real GDP:
- **Germany (solid line)**: There is a general upward trend in real GDP from 2014 to 2023. However, noticeable dips occur around 2020 and 2022.
- **United States (dashed line)**: The real GDP trend is also upward, with a sharp drop in 2020 (likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic), followed by a strong recovery. The growth rate seems higher compared to Germany, especially post-2021.

#### Data Sources:
- **Panel (a)**: Energy CPI in the US (FRED: CPIENGSL) and energy HICP for Germany (Eurostat: EI_CPHI_M:CP-HIE).
- **Panel (b)**: GDP in the US (FRED: GDPC1) and in Germany (Eurostat: NAMQ_10_GDP:B1G).

Both metrics are indexed to 100 in 2015, providing a clear comparative perspective on the trends over the surveyed period.
