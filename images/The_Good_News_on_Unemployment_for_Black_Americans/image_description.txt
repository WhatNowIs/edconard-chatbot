The image is a line graph from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) showing the unemployment rate for Black or African American men aged 20 years and over, spanning from 1973 to 2023. The data was sourced from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Key insights from the graph include:

- The unemployment rate fluctuated significantly over the years, with peaks and troughs coinciding with periods of economic recession (visible as shaded areas in the graph).
- Notable peaks in unemployment were seen around the years 1982, 1992, 2010, and 2020, corresponding to economic downturns or recessions.
- The highest unemployment rate in this period seems to have occurred in the early 1980s, reaching levels above 20%.
- Following the 1980s peak, there was a general downward trend in unemployment rates, albeit with notable increases during economic recessions, such as in the early 1990s and during the Great Recession of 2008-2009.
- The latest significant increase occurred around 2020, likely due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but there has been a sharp decline since then.
- Overall, while there have been periods of higher unemployment, the long-term trend indicates periods of recovery and reduction in unemployment rates to lower levels.

The graph underscores the volatility of the job market for Black or African American men over time and highlights the impact of economic cycles on unemployment rates.
