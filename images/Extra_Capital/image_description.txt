The image is a graph from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) showing the percent change from year ago in loans and leases in bank credit for all commercial banks, over the period from 2015 to 2024.

Key observations include:

1. **2015–2020:** The percent change in loans and leases generally maintained steady growth, peaking around 8% early in the shown period and experiencing some fluctuations while maintaining positive growth rates.
   
2. **2020 Onwards:** Around the period marking the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (early 2020), there is significant volatility. The percent change spikes up sharply, peaking at above 10%.

3. **Post-2020:** Following the peak, there is a sharp decline with the percent change turning negative, indicating a contraction in loans and leases. This sharp decrease recovers to positive territory but again declines sharply in 2022, reaching a low below -5%.

4. **2023–2024:** Recently, the graph shows a more stabilized yet moderately low percent change, hovering just above 0%, with a slight uptick indicated by the red circle.

In summary, the data indicates that loans and leases in bank credit for all commercial banks exhibited steady growth until early 2020, experienced significant volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and have been somewhat stabilizing in recent periods but at lower growth levels compared to pre-pandemic years.
