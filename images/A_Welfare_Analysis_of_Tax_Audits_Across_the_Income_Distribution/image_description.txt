The graph titled "FIGURE 5: Average Audit Revenue over Marginal Costs" shows a comparison of audit revenue to marginal costs across different TPI (Taxpayer Identification) percentile groups. The x-axis represents TPI percentile groups, divided into intervals ranging from 0-5th to 99.9+ percentiles. The y-axis represents Audit Revenue over Marginal Costs, with values ranging from 0 to 12.

Key observations from the graph:

1. **Baseline Values**: Represented by square points, the baseline audit revenue over marginal costs remains relatively constant and low for the lower percentile groups (0-70th percentile), showing no significant deviation.

2. **Increase in Higher Percentiles**: There is a notable increase in the ratio of audit revenue to marginal costs for the higher percentile groups (70-75th percentile and above). This increase is particularly significant as we move to the 90th percentile and beyond.

3. **Marked Values**:
   - At the 70th-75th percentile, the ratio is approximately 2.17.
   - At the 80th-85th percentile, the ratio rises to 2.99.
   - At the 95-99.9th percentile group, the ratio is 4.35.
   - The highest ratio observed at the 99.9+ percentile is significantly higher at 8.63.

4. **Error Bars**: The vertical lines extending from the square points indicate the lower and upper bounds, suggesting variability or uncertainty in the estimates. These error bars appear larger in the higher percentile groups, indicating greater variability in these estimates.

In summary, the graph demonstrates that audit revenue relative to marginal costs is fairly stable across the lower percentiles but increases significantly in the higher percentile groups, particularly beyond the 70th percentile. This suggests a higher financial return on audits for taxpayers in the top percentiles of the TPI distribution.
