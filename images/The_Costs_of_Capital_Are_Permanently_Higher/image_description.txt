The image is a line graph depicting the estimates by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) for the long-run federal funds rate. The graph covers the period from June 2015 to September 2023 and shows the central tendency, midpoint values in percentages.

Key Points:

1. **Trend Overview**: 
   - The longer-run FOMC estimate showed a general decline from mid-2015 through early 2021.
   - There was a steep drop from around 3.75% in June 2015 to about 2.50% around March 2021.
   - A steep recovery in the estimate began from March 2023.

2. **Recent Increase**:
   - From a low point in March 2021, the estimated long-run federal funds rate begins to rise steeply starting in March 2023.
   - By September 2023, the rate climbs to around 3.00%.

3. **Notable Dates**:
   - The rate held steady at approximately 2.50% from March 2020 to March 2021.
   - A significant increase starts becoming visible after March 2022, leading to a sharp rise by September 2023.

4. **Implication**:
   - The increase indicates that FOMC members are adjusting their expectations upward for the federal funds rate in the long run, perhaps due to changing economic conditions or new economic data influencing their outlook.

This graph could be useful for understanding FOMC members' evolving views on long-term interest rates and making financial or investment decisions based on expected future economic conditions.
