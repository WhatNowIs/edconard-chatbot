The chart outlines the change in wages for grocery workers as compared to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for food at home from 2005 to 2023, with 2019 as the base year (Index = 100). The key takeaways from the chart are:

1. **Steady Increase in Wages**: Both the wages of grocery retail workers and food manufacturing workers have shown a notable increase over the years.
   
2. **Recent Sharp Rise**: Wages, particularly for retail grocery store workers, have experienced a significant spike starting around 2020. By 2023, retail grocery store wages have outpaced both the CPI (food at home) and wages for food manufacturing.
   
3. **CPI Comparison**: The Consumer Price Index for food at home initially grew at a faster rate relative to wages until around 2019 but since then has been surpassed by the rise in wages for grocery workers.

4. **Current Index Values**: By 2023, the index for retail grocery store wages is the highest on the chart, followed by wages in food manufacturing, and then the CPI for food at home.
