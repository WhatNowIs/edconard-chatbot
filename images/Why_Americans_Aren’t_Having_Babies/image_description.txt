The provided image displays two interrelated graphs based on data from the Current Population Survey via the Aspen Economic Strategy Group. Here's a concise summary of the key information shown:

1. **Share of Women in the U.S. Age 35 to 44 Who Donâ€™t Have Children (1980-2020)**:
   - The percentage of women in the 35-44 age group without children has increased overall from 1980 to 2020.
   - Starting at about 10% in 1980, the proportion rose steadily, peaking around 20% in the early 2000s.
   - There was a slight decline and fluctuations between 2005 and 2015.
   - The share has been rising again, nearing 20% by 2020.

2. **Average Number of Live Births Per Woman in the U.S. Age 35 to 44 (1980-2020)**:
   - The average number of live births per woman in this age group decreased significantly from 1980 to the mid-2000s.
   - Starting near 3 births per woman in 1980, the number declined to around 2 by early 1990s.
   - From the mid-1990s onwards, it remained relatively stable at around 2 births per woman, with slight fluctuations.
   - The trend shows a small decrease towards the end of the observed period, just under 2 by 2020.

Overall, these graphs highlight a rising trend in childlessness among women aged 35 to 44 and a concurrent decline in the average number of live births per woman in this age group over the past four decades.
