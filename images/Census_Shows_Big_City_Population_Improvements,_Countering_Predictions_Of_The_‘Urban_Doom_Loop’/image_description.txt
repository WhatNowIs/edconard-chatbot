This image is a bar chart from Brookings Metro, sourced from William H. Frey's analysis of annual Census Bureau estimates from July to July (2020â€“2023 estimates are vintage 2023 estimates). The chart illustrates the annual population growth for U.S. cities with over 250,000 residents between 2000 and 2023.

Key highlights:

- From 2000-01 to 2019-20, the annual population growth in these cities fluctuated but generally maintained a positive trajectory, reaching a peak of approximately 1.0% between 2010-11 and 2011-12.
- There was a noticeable decline in population growth from 2015 onward.
- A significant drop occurred in 2020-21, with population growth falling to -0.89%, indicating a population decline.
- This trend continued in 2021-22 but began to recover slightly, reaching 0.14% in 2022-23.

The data emphasizes a major impact from around the period of 2020-2022, likely influenced by COVID-19, with a slight recovery starting in 2022-23.
