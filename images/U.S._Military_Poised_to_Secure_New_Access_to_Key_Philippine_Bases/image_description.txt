The image depicts two layered scenes on the water. In the foreground, there are two individuals in a small yellow fishing boat labeled "Tricia Marie." The boat appears to be wooden and equipped for small-scale fishing, and one of the individuals is wearing an orange vest while the other is in a yellow shirt handling the boat's equipment.

In the background, there is a large, modern vessel identified as a China Coast Guard ship with the hull number 3502 prominently displayed. The ship is painted white and bears the words "CHINA COAST GUARD" along with Chinese characters.

The juxtaposition of the small fishing boat with the large coast guard vessel might indicate a scenario involving maritime operations and interactions between local fishermen and official maritime authorities. The image suggests themes of territorial presence, maritime security, and possibly the challenges faced by local fishermen in areas monitored by national coast guards.
