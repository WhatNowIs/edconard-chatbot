The image provides a detailed analysis of the monthly changes in average hourly worker pay, annualized, from 2007 to 2023, categorized by different worker groups. Key points from the graph and accompanying text include:

- Wage growth for most Americans, represented by the red line, appears to be stabilizing at approximately 4.5% annually.
- This growth rate aligns with the pace just before the financial crisis and is around 2 percentage points faster than the growth observed between 2015 and 2019.
- The data is segmented into three categories:
  1. **Retail, leisure, and hospitality (nonsupervisory only)**: This group shows the most variability, particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic period (2020-2021).
  2. **All other nonsupervisory workers**: This group's wage growth is depicted by the red line and has been stabilizing recently.
  3. **Supervisory workers**: Represented by a green line, the wage growth for this group is comparatively more stable with less fluctuation over the years.
  
There are questions pointed out about whether wage growth will continue to slow down and whether productivity can keep pace to support these wage increases.

Overall, the data indicates the trends in wage growth by different worker groups, with special attention to the post-2015 and pandemic periods.
