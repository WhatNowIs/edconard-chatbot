The chart titled "Bank Treasury Holdings and Total Outstanding ($trn)" sourced from the Federal Reserve presents trends from 1945 to 2023. It includes three primary data series:

1. **Percent of Bank Assets in Treasuries (RHS, Right Hand Scale)**: Represented by the grey area, it shows a sharp decline from approximately 25% in 1945 to below 5% by the early 1990s. Since then, it has fluctuated but remained below this level through 2023.

2. **Total Bank Assets**: Represented by the blue line, it has shown substantial growth over the decades, particularly accelerating from around the early 2000s to 2023.

3. **Treasuries Outstanding**: Indicated by the yellow line, this series also reflects significant growth, particularly noticeable from the early 2000s onwards, aligning closely in trend with Total Bank Assets.

Key insights include the considerable decrease in the percentage of bank assets held in treasuries over the long term, contrasted by a large growth in both total bank assets and the amount of treasuries outstanding from the early 2000s to 2023.
