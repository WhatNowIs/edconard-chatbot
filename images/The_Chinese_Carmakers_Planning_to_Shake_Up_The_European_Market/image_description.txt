The image is a line graph titled "China's journey to become a car exporter" from the Financial Times, showing the trade in finished motor vehicles in terms of exports and imports (measured in billions of U.S. dollars) over the previous 12 months. The data spans from 2006 to 2023.

### Key Highlights:
1. **Exports:**
   - There's a steady increase in exports beginning around 2020, which sharply rises around 2021.
   - By 2023, the export value exceeds 80 billion USD.

2. **Imports:**
   - Imports show fluctuations with noticeable peaks and troughs between 2006 and 2020.
   - There is a gradual decrease in imports from around 2021 onwards, with a significant drop by 2023, falling below 40 billion USD.

### Summary:
China's automotive trade dynamics have significantly shifted over the years. From 2006 to around 2020, imports generally surpassed exports with fluctuating patterns. However, starting from 2021, Chinaâ€™s exports of finished motor vehicles experienced a substantial surge, overtaking imports, which concurrently exhibited a declining trend. By 2023, China firmly established itself as a major car exporter, with exports vastly outstripping imports, indicating a transformative phase in its automotive trade sector.
