The image shows a graph of U.S. construction spending from 2004 to 2023, depicting both residential and nonresidential sectors. The y-axis represents spending in trillions of dollars, up to $2 trillion, while the x-axis represents the years from 2004 through 2022.

Key points from the graph:

1. In the period leading up to the recession (2008-2009), construction spending peaked around $1.3 trillion, with a significant portion allocated to residential construction.
2. During the recession, construction spending dropped sharply to below $0.8 trillion, with a noticeable decline in both residential and nonresidential spending.
3. Post-recession, there was a gradual recovery in construction spending. 
4. From around 2011 onwards, construction spending steadily increased, with notable peaks and troughs.
5. By around 2022-2023, U.S. construction spending reached new heights, surpassing the previous peaks, approaching almost $2 trillion.
6. Nonresidential spending consistently made up a larger portion of total spending, compared to residential spending.

Overall, this graph illustrates the resilience and growth of the U.S. construction industry over the past two decades, highlighting significant downturns during the recession and substantial rebounds in subsequent years.
