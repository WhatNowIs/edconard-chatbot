The image shows Figure 4, titled "Young and Incumbent Inventor Hires," which is a graph displaying the event study estimates for outcomes related to inventors over time, relative to their hire date. The data differentiates between inventors hired by incumbent firms and those hired by young firms. 

### Key Points:
- **Vertical Axis (y-axis):** Represents the estimate levels.
- **Horizontal Axis (x-axis):** Represents the years relative to the hire date, ranging from -4 to 4.
- **Dots and Error Bars:**
  - **Gray dots:** Represent patent applications.
  - **Black dots:** Represent log earnings.
  - Error bars indicate variability or confidence intervals around the estimates.
  
### Findings:
1. **Patent Applications (Gray Dots):**
   - Before hiring (years -4 to -1), the patent application estimates remain near zero.
   - After hiring (years 1 to 4), there is a slight, not statistically significant decline in patent application estimates.
   
2. **Log Earnings (Black Dots):**
   - Before hiring (years -4 to -1), the log earnings estimates remain near zero.
   - After hiring (years 1 to 4), there is a noticeable significant increase in log earnings estimates, indicating that inventors see a rise in earnings post-hiring.

### Notes:
- The data is sourced from the Inventor Employment History and Founding Team Database.
- The analysis matches inventor hire events at young firms (≤ 5 years old) and incumbent firms (≥ 21 years old and > 1,000 employees). 
- The estimates provided are derived from Equation 4 mentioned in the notes.

### Summary:
This graph highlights that when comparing inventors hired by young versus incumbent firms, there is a negligible impact on patent application rates post-hiring. However, inventors hired by young firms experience significant increases in their earnings after being hired. This suggests that while young firms may not significantly influence the number of patents an inventor files, joining such firms appears to be financially beneficial for the inventors.
