The chart titled "Estimated annualized cost of servicing US government debt: $1 trillion" provides an overview of the estimated monthly cost of servicing US debt (depicted by the green line) and the 10-year interest rates (depicted by the blue line) over time from January 1980 to March 2023.

Key Details:
- The green line represents the estimated monthly cost of servicing US debt, calculated as an annualized value in trillions of dollars. This cost has notably increased over time and has seen significant rises in recent years.
- The blue line represents the 10-year interest rates on the right-hand scale (RHS), depicted as a percentage. There are fluctuations in the rates seen throughout the years, with notable declines and increases.
- The chart also highlights recession periods with shaded vertical bars, indicating how these economic downturns coincide with changes in interest rates and debt servicing costs.
- Recent data show a sharp rise in the estimated monthly cost of US debt, climbing towards $0.9 trillion, and a significant spike in interest rates, nearing or surpassing 18%.

Source Information:
- The data sources include Treasury, Haver Analytics, and Apollo Chief Economist.
- It is noted that the estimated monthly cost is calculated as the average interest rate total outstanding in both marketable and non-marketable debt and includes public debt and intragovernmental holdings.

Summary:
The cost of servicing US government debt has reached $1 trillion annually, with a significant rise observed in recent years. 10-year interest rates have shown fluctuations over the decades but are currently experiencing a sharp increase. The data suggests a correlation between rising debt servicing costs and higher interest rates, especially during and after recession periods.
