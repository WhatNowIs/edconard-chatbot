This graph presents the spread between the 30-year mortgage and the 10-year Treasury yield, both in interest rates and basis points (bps), from January 2015 to July 2023. The key points are:

1. **Interest Rates**:
   - **10-Year Treasury (blue line)**: 
     - It started around 2% in January 2015 and remained somewhat stable, fluctuating slightly.
     - A notable decline occurred around mid-2020 (likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic), dropping below 1%.
     - There was a gradual rise post-2020, fluctuating around the 3-4% range in the most recent data.
   - **PMMS 30-Year Conforming Rate (green line)**:
     - This rate was around 4% in January 2015 and experienced slightly more fluctuations compared to the Treasury yield.
     - Around 2020, it fell below 3% but later saw a sharp increase, exceeding 6% by mid-2022 and remaining elevated compared to historical levels.

2. **Spread (grey bars)**:
   - The spread between the 30-year mortgage and the 10-year Treasury remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations around 150-250 bps before 2020.
   - Post-2020, there is a significant rise in the spread, peaking around 400 bps in recent data.

3. **Overall Trends**:
   - Prior to 2020, the difference between the 30-year mortgage rate and 10-year Treasury yield was relatively stable.
   - Since the pandemic, there's a notable increase in both the overall level of mortgage rates and the spread between these rates and the 10-year Treasury yield.
