The map illustrates changes in the population of children aged 0-4 across various counties in the United States between April 2020 and July 2022. The changes are categorized into population growth (represented by blue dots) and population decline (represented by brown dots), with the size of the circles indicating the absolute change in population.

Key observations are:

1. **Overall Distribution**:
   - There is a widespread decrease in the population of children aged 0-4 (more brown dots) across most counties.
   - Some areas have seen growth (blue dots) but are less frequent.

2. **Regional Insights**:
   - **West Coast**: Significant population declines are evident, especially in counties in California and the neighboring states, as indicated by large brown circles.
   - **Central U.S.**: Many counties show slight to moderate decreases in the young population.
   - **East Coast**: Similar to the West Coast, there is a notable decline in population, with some exceptions where slight growth is observed.
   - **South**: Florida and Texas show mixed results with both declines and some areas of growth.

3. **Specific Areas of Interest**:
   - Major metropolitan areas, including those in California, Texas, and the northeastern U.S., have large declines.
   - Some isolated regions, particularly in the Southeast and Midwest, show growth.

4. **Overall Trend**:
   - The map suggests a greater tendency towards declines in the young population across the U.S., with fewer areas experiencing growth.
