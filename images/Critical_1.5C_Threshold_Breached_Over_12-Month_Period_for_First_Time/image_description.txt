Key points:
1. **Decadal SST Trends**:
   - The decades from the 1980s to the 2020s are displayed.
   - There is a noticeable upward trend in SST over the decades, with each decade showing progressively higher temperatures.

2. **Record High in 2024**:
   - The year 2024 is marked as starting with record-high sea surface temperatures.
   - An absolute record was reached on February 4, 2024, with an SST of 21.12째C, surpassing the previous high set in August of the previous year, 2023.

3. **Monthly Data**:
   - Temperature data is plotted for each month from January (J) to December (D). 
   - The temperature ranges for each decade show more fluctuation and higher peaks in recent years compared to the earlier decades.
