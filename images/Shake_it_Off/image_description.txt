This graph, sourced from Bloomberg, illustrates the relationship between interest rates and the Nasdaq index during the late 1990s and early 2000s. It spans from January 1997 to January 2003 and includes three key metrics:

1. **10 Year Yield** (in orange, left axis): This represents the interest rate on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds.
2. **Fed Funds Rate** (in black, left axis): The interest rate at which depository institutions lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight.
3. **Nasdaq Composite Index** (in blue, right axis): A stock market index that includes almost all stocks listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

Key observations:

- From January 1997 to early 2000, the Nasdaq index (blue line) saw a substantial increase, reflecting the dot-com bubble, peaking around early 2000.
- Concurrently, the 10 Year Yield (orange line) fluctuated around 5-6%, showing some minor ups and downs.
- The Fed Funds Rate (black line) remained relatively stable until late 1998 when it began to gradually rise, peaking in early 2000.
- Post-2000, the Nasdaq sharply declined, marking the burst of the dot-com bubble, dropping dramatically through 2001.
- The 10 Year Yield declined slightly during the same period, but then settled around 4-5% from 2001 onwards.
- The Fed Funds Rate also dropped significantly from 2001, reaching around 1-2% by the end of the period shown.

In summary, this graph captures the influence of rising interest rates on the Nasdaq boom and subsequent bust around the turn of the millennium. The dot-com bubble is prominently reflected in the Nasdaq's performance, while the Fed's monetary policy and bond yields show a response to economic conditions during this volatile period.
