The chart provides a longitudinal view of the holding patterns of US Treasuries by different groups from 1997 to 2023, highlighting the impact of the Federal Reserve (Fed) raising interest rates. The data is categorized into four groups: the Federal Reserve, Households, Real Money, and Foreign entities. Here’s a summary of the key insights:

1. **Federal Reserve Holdings**:
   - The Fed's holdings of US Treasuries remained relatively low and stable until around 2008.
   - A sharp increase is observed from 2008 onwards, peaking in 2022, followed by a decline that coincides with the Fed starting to raise rates in 2022.

2. **Household Holdings**:
   - Households' investments in US Treasuries have shown a general upward trend, especially significant increases post-2020, aligning with the Fed’s rate hike.

3. **Real Money Holdings** (institutions like insurance companies, pension funds, etc.):
   - These holdings maintained a gradual increase over the years until 2020, experiencing a spike post-2020 then stabilizing slightly lower than the peak.

4. **Foreign Holdings**:
   - Foreign entities have consistently held a significant portion of US Treasuries but the growth rate flattened post-2014.
   - There was a noticeable decline around 2020, recovering slightly in subsequent years.

**Overall Trends**:
- The Fed's aggressive purchasing of Treasuries starting in 2008 and peaking by 2020 reflects its quantitative easing policies.
- Households and Real Money significantly increased their holdings from 2020 onwards, suggesting a shift towards safer investments amid economic uncertainties.
- Foreign investment in US Treasuries, while stable for a long period, showed some volatility around the economic events of 2020.

These trends underscore the dynamic shifts in who holds US Treasuries in response to economic policies and global events, with notable reactions to the Fed's interest rate changes.
