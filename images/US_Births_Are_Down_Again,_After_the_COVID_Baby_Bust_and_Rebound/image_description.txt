The image from Brookings shows four graphs, each depicting the trend in birth numbers in the United States from 2016 to 2022, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The graphs illustrate a consistent long-term decline in the number of births across different quarters. Each graph uses quarters to align conceptions with birth data and highlights significant dates around which changes are noted.

Here are the key points from each graph:

1. **Conceptions in Quarter 1, Births in Quarter 4**:
   - Presents a near-steady decline in births from 2016 to 2022, starting from about 980,000 to approximately 910,000.
   - A noticeable dip occurs around the likely conception of Quarter 1, 2020.

2. **Conceptions in Quarter 2, Births in Quarter 1**:
   - Shows a slight drop from around 950,000 births in 2016 to around 900,000 by 2022.
   - A more abrupt decrease is seen around the likely conception of Quarter 2, 2020, followed by a minor rebound.

3. **Conceptions in Quarter 3, Births in Quarter 2**:
   - Observes a decline from just over 1,000,000 births in 2016 to just under 900,000 in 2022.
   - A notable dip around the likely conception of Quarter 3, 2019.

4. **Conceptions in Quarter 4, Births in Quarter 3**:
   - Displays a consistent downward trend from about 1,070,000 births in 2016 to around 950,000 in 2022.
   - A significant drop is observed around the likely conception of Quarter 4, 2019.

Common Insights:
- All graphs indicate a steady decrease in birth rates over the period from 2016 to 2022.
- The data emphasizes strong seasonal patterns in birth rates which are accounted for in the reports.
- Declines in birth rates coincide with particular quarters, notably around early 2020, likely influenced by external factors such as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Overall, the set of graphs confirms an ongoing long-term decline in birth rates across different seasons and quarters from 2016 to 2022.
