The image shows a line graph that compares the annual percentage growth in the US aggregate money supply (M2) forwarded by 15 months with US CPI inflation from January 1962 to June 2025.

Key details:
- The M2 growth rate is represented by the blue line, while the inflation rate is depicted by the orange line (using the right-hand scale).
- Over the period examined, the M2 growth rate and inflation have shown notable fluctuations.
- Significant spikes in both metrics occurred during the 1970s and early 1980s.
- Since the early 1980s, both metrics have generally exhibited smaller variations compared to the earlier period.
- More recently, there was an evident spike in the M2 growth rate around 2020 which subsequently dropped sharply.
- Similarly, there was an increase in inflation right after the M2 spike, which then declined.

In summary, the graph illustrates the historical and projected correlation between money supply (M2) growth and inflation in the US, indicating that changes in money supply are predictive of future inflation trends, particularly noticeable at multiple points from 1962 to 2025.
