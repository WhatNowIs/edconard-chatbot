The image depicts the projected shares of the global population aged 15 to 24 in various regions of the world for the years 2023 and 2050. Key points from the image are summarized as follows:

1. **Africa**:
   - 2023: 23% of the global population aged 15-24.
   - 2050: 35%, showing a significant increase.

2. **Southern Asia**:
   - 2023: 29%.
   - 2050: 26%, indicating a slight decrease.

3. **Eastern and Southeastern Asia**:
   - 2023: 24%.
   - 2050: 17%, showing a notable decrease.

4. **Latin America and the Caribbean**:
   - 2023: 8.6%.
   - 2050: 6.9%, showing a decline.

5. **Europe**:
   - 2023: 6.3%.
   - 2050: 5.1%, indicating a decline.

6. **Western Asia**:
   - 2023: 4%.
   - 2050: 4.4%, showing a slight increase.

7. **Northern America**:
   - 2023: 4%.
   - 2050: 3.5%, indicating a decrease.

The image underscores that by 2050, more than a third (35%) of the global young population (aged 15-24) will live in Africa. This significant increase contrasts with the declining shares of young people in regions such as Southern Asia, Eastern and Southeastern Asia, and Europe.
