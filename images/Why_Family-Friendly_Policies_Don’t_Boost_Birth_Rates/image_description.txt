The image illustrates the relationship between public spending on pro-child/family-friendly policies and total fertility rates in six countries (France, US, UK, Finland, Spain, and Korea) from 1985 to 2022. The spending is displayed in constant USD per capita, while the fertility rate is shown on a separate scale. Here are the main points extracted from the image:

1. **Increased Spending on Family-Friendly Policies**:
   - Across all six countries, public spending on pro-child policies such as child benefits and allowances, parental leave benefits, childcare support, and tax breaks for parents has significantly increased since 1985.

2. **Falling Birth Rates**:
   - Despite the rise in spending, total fertility rates have continued to decline and fall far below the replacement level (approximately 2.1 children per woman) in all the countries.

3. **Country-Specific Trends**:
   - **OECD Average**: Shows a general increase in spending and a steady decline in fertility rates.
   - **France**: Experiences a substantial increase in spending but a consistent decline in fertility rates.
   - **US**: Has a moderate increase in spending alongside a marked decrease in fertility rates.
   - **UK**: Exhibits substantial increases in spending and a significant decline in fertility rates.
   - **Finland**: Shows consistent growth in spending and a notable fall in fertility rates.
   - **Spain**: Experiences increased spending with a steep decline in fertility rates.
   - **Korea**: Shows a notable surge in spending and one of the steepest declines in fertility rates.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The graphic highlights a clear trend where rising investment in family-friendly policies across these countries has not been successful in reversing or halting the declining trend in birth rates.
