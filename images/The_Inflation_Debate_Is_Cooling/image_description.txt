The graph, titled "The Beveridge of your choice," presents the relationship between the private vacancy rate and the unemployment rate. It spans three different time periods:

1. **Prepandemic:** Displayed in blue, this period shows a relatively stable and lower private vacancy rate ranging from approximately 1.5 to 3.0 as the unemployment rate increases from 4.0 to just over 8.0.

2. **2020-2021:** Represented in orange, this period shows a significant rise in the private vacancy rate starting from around 6.0, peaking above 8.0, as the unemployment rate increased from under 5.0 to about 15.0. After the peak, the vacancy rate decreases slightly but remains elevated compared to the pre-pandemic period.

3. **Post 2022:** Illustrated in gray, this period indicates a transitionary point from 2020-2021 levels, with private vacancy rates around 6.0-7.0 as unemployment gradually decreases from about 8.0 downwards.

The data reveals a noticeable shift in the Beveridge curve before and during the pandemic, indicating higher vacancy rates at similar unemployment levels during the pandemic period compared to the prepandemic period. This may suggest changes in labor market dynamics due to the pandemic.
