The provided image features a title that reads "Not Out of the Woods," suggesting that despite recent trends, the issue at hand is not yet resolved. The text explains that the prices of many inputs have been rising at an accelerating rate, which is leading to inflation for end-users. This indicates that the apparent inflation slowdown in the second half of 2023 might have been a temporary fluke.

The graphical data illustrates changes in select U.S. input and output costs using the Producer Price Index (PPI) over various years. The lines represent different categories:
- Core final demand (blue) - excluding food, energy, and distributive services.
- Components for manufacturing (red).
- Supplies (green).
- All imports excluding food and fuels (orange).

The graph spans from 2014 to 2024 and shows fluctuations in these categories' annualized rates. Notably, there are significant spikes shown for categories around 2021 and 2022, indicating heightened inflation pressures during these periods.

In summary, the image emphasizes that rising input costs are contributing to ongoing inflation, and the reduction seen in late 2023 might not be sustainable in the long-term.
