This image outlines China's dominance in the production of key components for batteries, using data from 2021 provided by the IEA and Yano Research Institute. Here are the main points:

1. **Cathodes**:
   - China produces 77% of cathodes.
   - Cathodes in the illustration are composed of Nickel (Ni), Manganese (Mn), and Cobalt (Co).

2. **Separators**:
   - China manufactures 74% of separators.
   - Separators allow lithium ions (Li) to move between the cathode and anode during charging and discharging.

3. **Electrolytes**:
   - China supplies 82% of electrolytes.
   
4. **Anodes**:
   - China produces 92% of anodes.
   - Anodes are composed mainly of Carbon (C).

5. **Lithium Ion Movement**:
   - Lithium ions (Li) shuttle back and forth between the cathode and anode during battery charging and discharging processes.

This visualization underscores China's critical role in the battery supply chain, particularly in the production of cathodes, anodes, separators, and electrolytes.
