The image provides a comparison of installed power capacity and the capacity in queues in the US for the years 2010 and 2022, focusing on various energy sources. The data is measured in gigawatts (GW). Here's a detailed summary based on the chart:

### Summary:

#### **2010:**
- **Installed Power Capacity:**
  - Solar: Minimal
  - Wind: Substantial portion
  - Hydro: Present
  - Storage (+ hybrid): Negligible
  - Nuclear: Present
  - Gas: Significant portion
  - Coal: Major portion
  - Other: Present

- **Queues for Power Capacity:**
  - Solar: Minimal
  - Wind: Present
  - Hydro: Negligible
  - Storage (+ hybrid): Negligible
  - Nuclear: Present
  - Gas: Major portion
  - Coal: Present
  - Other: Negligible

#### **2022:**
- **Installed Power Capacity:**
  - Solar: Increased substantially
  - Wind: Increased
  - Hydro: Remains relatively the same
  - Storage (+ hybrid): Significant increase
  - Nuclear: Relatively the same
  - Gas: Notable portion but reduced comparatively
  - Coal: Decreased substantially
  - Other: Present

- **Queues for Power Capacity:**
  - Solar: Substantial increase
  - Wind: Substantial increase
  - Hydro: Minimal
  - Storage (+ hybrid): Significant increase
  - Nuclear: Minimal
  - Gas: Increased
  - Coal: Minimal
  - Other: Present

### Key Observations:
1. **Shift to Clean Energy**: Thereâ€™s a notable increase in the queued capacity for solar and wind projects in 2022 compared to 2010, reflecting a shift towards clean energy.
2. **Decrease in Fossil Fuels**: Installed capacities of coal and gas have decreased over the period, suggesting a move away from these fossil fuels.
3. **Increase in Storage**: Energy storage projects have seen a significant rise in both installed and queued capacities by 2022.
4. **Installed vs. Queued**: The queued capacities, especially for renewable energy sources (solar and wind), are substantially higher in 2022 compared to the installed capacities, indicating a growing interest and investment in renewable energy projects.
