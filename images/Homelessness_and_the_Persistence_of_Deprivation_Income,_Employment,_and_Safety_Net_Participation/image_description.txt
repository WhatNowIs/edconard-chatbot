### Key Takeaways:

1. **Share with Earnings:**
   - The overall housed population consistently has the highest proportion of individuals with earnings.
   - Both sheltered and unsheltered homeless populations exhibit a decline in the proportion of those with earnings over the observed period.
   - The single housed poor also show a decreasing trend in share with earnings but remain higher than homeless groups.

2. **Median Earnings:**
   - Overall housed individuals not only have the highest proportion of earnings but also the highest median earnings, showing a steady increase over the years.
   - Single housed poor see an increase in earnings but remain notably below the overall housed.
   - Both sheltered and unsheltered homeless individuals have significantly lower median earnings, with the unsheltered homeless being particularly disadvantaged.

These charts highlight the continuing economic disparities faced by homeless and poor populations compared to the overall housed population.
