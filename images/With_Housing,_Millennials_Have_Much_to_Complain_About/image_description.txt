The image is a line chart titled "A Better View of Homeownership By Age." It shows the percentage of individuals who are homeowners across different age groups over time. 

### Key Points:
1. **Age Groups:**
   - Blue Line: Individuals aged 25-34
   - Black Line: Individuals aged 35-64
   - Gray Line: Individuals aged 65 and older

2. **Time Span:**
   - The chart spans from the year 1976 to around 2020.

3. **Observational Trends:**
   - The homeownership rate for individuals aged 25-34 (blue line) shows a general downward trend.
   - The homeownership rate for individuals aged 35-64 (black line) and those aged 65 and older (gray line) remains relatively stable with slight fluctuations over the years.
   - The percentages are color-coded with the corresponding lines.

4. **Data Source:**
   - The data comes from the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement microdata, accessed via IPUMS-CPS, University of Minnesota (www.ipums.org).

5. **Specific Note:**
   - The chart specifies that the data refers to heads of household and spouses in homeowner households, divided by the number of individuals in each age group.

In summary, the chart illustrates that younger individuals (25-34) have seen a decline in homeownership rates over the past decades, while the rates for older individuals (both 35-64 and 65 and older) have remained more stable.
