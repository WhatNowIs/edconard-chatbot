The image presents Figure 3, which illustrates the treatment effect on support for redistribution by country, featuring two sub-figures (a) and (b).

1. **Figure 3a**:
   - This scatter plot shows the treatment effect on support for redistribution across different countries: Australia, France, Germany, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States.
   - The y-axis represents the treatment effect, ranging from -0.3 to 0.3.
   - The dots signify the differences in mean scores of the treatment effect, with vertical bars indicating the 95% confidence intervals.
   - Findings:
     - The United States shows a negative treatment effect on support for redistribution, with the confidence interval crossing zero.
     - Australia, France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom show positive treatment effects. 

2. **Figure 3b**:
   - This bar graph compares the mean levels of support for redistribution under control and treatment conditions for the same six countries.
   - The y-axis ranges from 3.00 to 4.00.
   - Support for redistribution is higher under treatment conditions in Australia, France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
   - In the United States, the control group shows higher support for redistribution compared to the treatment group.
   - Standard errors for these means are presented as error bars.

Summary: The figures demonstrate that treatment has a varying impact on support for redistribution by country. Specifically, all countries except the United States exhibit increased support for redistribution under treatment conditions. In contrast, the United States sees a decrease in support for redistribution under treatment conditions.
