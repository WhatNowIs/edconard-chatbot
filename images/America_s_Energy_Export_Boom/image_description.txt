The graph titled "The US is Now an Energy Exporter" illustrates the growth of America's net energy exports over the past decade. Key points include:

- The y-axis measures the dollar amount, ranging from -$300 billion to $150 billion.
- The x-axis spans the years 2013 to 2024.
- There are two lines: a dashed line representing monthly annualized values and a solid line representing a 12-month moving total of US net energy exports.
- At the start of the period (around 2013), the US was a significant net energy importer, with figures near -$250 billion.
- Over the decade, there has been a noticeable and consistent rise in net energy exports, transitioning to positive figures around 2019.
- By 2020 and onwards, energy exports have remained in the positive range, indicating the US has become a consistent net exporter of energy.
- As of the latest data in the graph (2023), the positive net energy exports stand around $50 billion.

The data implies significant structural changes in the US energy market and policies over the past decade, transitioning the country from a net energy importer to an exporter.
