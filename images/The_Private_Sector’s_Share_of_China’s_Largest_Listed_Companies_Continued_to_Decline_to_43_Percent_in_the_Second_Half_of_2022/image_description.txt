The chart illustrates the changes in the market capitalization share of China's top 100 listed firms from December 31, 2010, to December 31, 2022, classified by ownership type: state-owned, mixed-ownership, and nonpublic.

Key highlights from the chart include:

1. **State-owned Companies**:
   - The market share of state-owned enterprises remains dominant throughout the decade, starting above 60% in 2010 and experiencing slight fluctuation but largely maintaining a significant majority.

2. **Mixed-Ownership Companies**:
   - These companies saw considerable growth from 2010 onward, peaking around 2020. Since then, their share has slightly declined but still represents a notable portion of the market by 2022.

3. **Nonpublic Companies**:
   - The share of nonpublic (most likely private sector) companies displayed growth, especially starting around 2018, but began declining after June 2021, which is a specific point noted in the title.

Overall, the chart shows a general rise in mixed-ownership and nonpublic companies' market shares until a decline around 2021 onwards, while state-owned enterprises maintain substantial dominance in the largest listed companies in China.
