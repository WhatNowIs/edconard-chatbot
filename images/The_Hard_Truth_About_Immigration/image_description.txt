The chart, created by The Atlantic using data from the Migration Policy Institute and the World Inequality Database, displays two key trends in the United States from 1920 to 2010:

1. **Income Share of Bottom Half of U.S. Households (Red Line):**
   - The income share of the bottom 50% of U.S. households started at around 15% in 1920.
   - It saw fluctuations, including a rise during the 1940s and again in the 1960s.
   - The peak was reached in the 1970s and early 1980s when the share exceeded 20%.
   - Following the 1980s, there was a significant decline, bringing the share down to below 15% by 2010.

2. **Share of U.S. Residents Born in Another Country (Blue Line):**
   - The share of foreign-born residents began at above 10% in 1920.
   - A steady decline ensued, reaching its lowest point just below 5% in the 1970s.
   - Post-1970s, there was a notable increase, raising the foreign-born share back above 10% by 2010.

Summary:
The chart illustrates an inverse relationship over the 90-year span: as the share of U.S. residents born in another country decreased until the mid-20th century and then increased afterward, the income share of the bottom half of U.S. households followed an almost opposite trajectory, peaking mid-century and subsequently declining toward the end of the period.
