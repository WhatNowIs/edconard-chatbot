The image is a graph titled "Monetary Policy is Tighter Than It Seems," illustrating the gap between the Federal Reserve's actual policy rate and the QT-equivalent (Quantitative Tightening) policy rate, along with their projections.

Key points include:

1. **Actual Policy Rate vs. QT-Equivalent Policy Rate**:
   - The actual policy rate (solid dark blue line) has risen from around 1% in early 2022 to above 5% by 2024.
   - The QT-equivalent policy rate (solid black line), which includes the impact of balance-sheet shrinkage, begins slightly higher than the actual policy rate and shows a growing gap, reaching over 6% by 2025.

2. **Projections**:
   - The actual rate projections (dotted blue line) about 5.5% in early 2024, then declining gradually to around 4% by 2026.
   - The QT-equivalent projections (dotted black line) suggest a peak at about 6% in 2024, remaining relatively higher than the actual rate projections throughout, before falling to approximately 4.5% by 2025, and indicates a steadier decline post-2025.

3. **Impact of Balance-Sheet Reduction**:
   - The graph highlights a projected significant divergence between the actual policy rate and the QT-equivalent rate, influenced by balance-sheet reduction, marked with a grey dotted line showing the projected end of balance-sheet reduction around 2025.

4. **Sources**:
   - The graph's data comes from the Federal Reserve and authors' calculations.

The overall implication is that the Federal Reserve's policy rate might not fully reflect the tightness of current monetary policy as balance-sheet shrinkage contributes additional tightening, leading to a potentially larger impact on economic conditions than the policy rate alone suggests.
