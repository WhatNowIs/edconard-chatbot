The figure provides an analysis of manufacturing productivity over time, breaking down the productivity index at the firm level and distinguishing between leader and follower firms. The data spans from 1987 to 2022.

### Key Points:

1. **Productivity Index Trends (Left Chart):**
   - The graph on the left measures productivity indices using two data sources: Compustat and BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics).
   - **Compustat Metrics:**
     - **Revenue per Worker (Current Weight, Blue Solid Line):** Shows a consistent increase in productivity from 1987, peaking around 2010, followed by a decline up to 2022.
     - **Initial Weight (Blue Dashed Line):** Displays similar trends but with slight variations in growth and decline rates.
   - **BLS Metrics:**
     - **Gross Output per Worker (Current Weight, Brown Solid Line):** Also follows an upward trajectory peaking around 2007 with slight fluctuations and a decline towards 2022.
     - **Initial Weight (Brown Dashed Line):** Mirrors the trends seen in the current weight metrics.

2. **Disparities Between Leader and Follower Firms (Right Chart):**
   - The graph on the right distinguishes productivity between leader firms (solid red line) and follower firms (dashed red line).
   - **Leader Firms:** Display higher productivity growth initially, peaking around 2010, but exhibit a decline afterward similar to the overall trends observed in the left chart.
   - **Follower Firms:** Show steady growth, peaking later than leader firms, and subsequently experience a downturn, highlighting a gradual catch-up followed by a simultaneous decline across both tiers of firms.

### Summary:
Overall, the productivity slowdown in manufacturing appears to be a broad trend affecting various strata within the industry. Both leader and follower firms show significant productivity growth from 1987 to around 2010, after which a decline is observed. The trends suggest that this slowdown is not isolated but pervasive across different types of firms, pointing to underlying broader structural issues within the manufacturing sector.
