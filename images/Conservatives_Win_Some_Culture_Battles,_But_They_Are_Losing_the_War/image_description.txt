The image illustrates how "culture war" politics in anglophone countries have turned immigration into a polarizing issue across generations and political parties. It visualizes immigration preferences by age group (15-24 to 65+) over three time periods: 1995-1998, 2005-2009, and 2017-2022. 

Key observations:
1. Over time, there has been a noticeable divergence in immigration preferences, especially in anglophone countries.
2. In recent years (2017-2022), preferences in anglophone countries have shown greater polarization compared to other developed countries.
3. Younger generations (ages 15-24) in anglophone countries tend to support more open immigration policies, while older generations (ages 65+) lean towards stricter immigration controls.
4. This polarization phenomenon is less pronounced in other developed countries.

The image suggests that immigration has become a significant dividing line in anglophone countries, separating younger and older generations more distinctly than in other developed nations.
