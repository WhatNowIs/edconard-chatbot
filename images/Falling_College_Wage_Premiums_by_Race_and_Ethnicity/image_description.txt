Key observations from the graph:

1. **Asian**: Represented by the green line, Asians have the highest and most volatile wage premium, starting around 85% in the year 2000 and peaking above 120% around 2017, then experiencing a slight decline towards 2020.

Whites and Blacks have moderate but relatively stable wage premiums over the years.
