The image is a line graph comparing three different measures of rent growth over time from 2005 to 2021. The three measures are:

1. BLS NTRR (represented by the black line),
2. BLS ATRR (represented by the blue line), and
3. CPI Rent (represented by the purple line).

Key points from the graph and its description:

- **Time Period**: The data spans from the third quarter of 2005 to the third quarter of 2021.
- **Percent Change**: The y-axis represents the percentage change in rent.
- **CPI Rent**: This indicates the rent of primary residences.
- **Gray Shaded Region**: This likely represents a confidence interval or some measure of variance around the BLS NTRR line.
- **Trend**: Over the period from 2005 to around 2017, all three measures generally move together, showing similar trends in rent growth.
- **Divergence**: Post-2017, there are some differences between the measures, but all generally maintain close parity until 2021.
- **Significant Increase Post-2020**: There is a noticeable sharp increase in the BLS NTRR around 2021, signaling a significant rise in rent growth compared to the other measures.

The source of the data is the BLS Housing Survey, and further details on the construction of ATRR and NTRR are described in a specific section of the document (Section 3).

**Summary**: This graph illustrates the trends in rent growth percentages using three different measures over a sixteen-year period. While the measures follow similar paths, a notable divergence is observed in 2021, particularly in the BLS NTRR, suggesting unprecedented rent increases around this time.
