The chart from Bloomberg titled "Recession Call" illustrates the relationship between various interest rates from December 2021 to November 2022. 

Key points extracted from the chart are:

1. **Primary Focus:**
   - The chart indicates that the 10-year Treasury yield has fallen below the short-end yields and overnight policy benchmarks, which suggests an inversion in the yield curve, often seen as a precursor to a recession.

2. **Rates on the Chart:**
   - **Treasury 10-year Yield** is plotted in black.
   - **Treasury 2-year Yield** is plotted in red.
   - **Federal Funds Target Rate Bounds**: 
     - Upper Bound is in dark blue.
     - Lower Bound is in light blue.

3. **Observation Period:**
   - The period covered is from December 2021 to November 2022.

4. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Throughout 2022, the Federal Funds Target Rate (both upper and lower bounds) has been on an upward trajectory, increasing in multiple steps.
   - The Treasury 2-year yield (red) has also shown an upward trend and has remained consistently above the 10-year yield (black) starting around mid-2022.
   - The 10-year yield shows a more fluctuating pattern but generally increases until about mid-2022 and then levels off slightly below the Federal Funds Target Rate.

5. **Current Status (as of November 2022):**
   - The 10-year yield is slightly below 4%.
   - The 2-year yield is slightly above 4%.
   - The Federal Funds Target Upper Bound is approximately at 4%.
   - The Federal Funds Target Lower Bound is approximately at 3.75%.

This inversion, where short-term rates exceed long-term rates, signals a potential slowdown in economic growth and an increased risk of recession as perceived by investors.
