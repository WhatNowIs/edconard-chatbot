**Exhibit 9: The Tech-Fueled Productivity Boom Starting in the Late 1990s Was Largely Captured Via Quality Adjustments to Price Deflators and Therefore Had a Direct and Mechanical Disinflationary Effect**

### Left Graph: Computer and Electronic Products
- This graph shows the year-over-year percentage change from 1988 to 2023 for Labor Productivity and Output Deflator.
- **Labor Productivity (blue line)**: 
  * Experienced sharp increases and peaks around the late 1990s, reaching up to 25% year-over-year growth.
  * After the peak in the late 1990s, it exhibited fluctuations with a general downward trend, maintaining close to zero or slightly positive changes post-2008. 
- **Output Deflator (red line)**: 
  * Initially negative in the 1980s and 1990s, indicating deflationary trends (around -15% at its lowest in the early 90s).
  * Post-1990s, it showed a gradual increase, nearing zero percentage change from 2013 to 2023.

### Right Graph: Contribution to Year-over-Year PCE Inflation from Consumer Electronics
- This graph tracks the contribution to year-over-year Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Inflation from consumer electronics from 1970 to 2023.
- Indicates a significant downward (disinflationary) trend beginning particularly in the 1990s, accompanied by periodic fluctuations.
- **Notably disinflationary points**:
  * In the late 1990s and the early 2000s, the contribution to PCE inflation was significantly negative.
  * Post-2018, this contribution trends towards zero, though still showcasing some negative impact.

### Summary:
The data illustrates that the tech productivity boom of the late 1990s was significantly influenced by quality adjustments in price deflators, manifesting a pronounced disinflationary effect. Labor productivity saw a peak surge during this time, while the output deflator, although initially negative, gradually moved towards zero. The contribution of consumer electronics to PCE inflation exhibited notable disinflation from the 1990s onwards, marking a direct impact on inflation trends due to advancements in technology and productivity.
