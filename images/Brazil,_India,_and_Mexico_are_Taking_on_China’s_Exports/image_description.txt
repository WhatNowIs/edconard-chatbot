The chart illustrates the industrial-production volumes of emerging economies from January 2019 to 2024, with the base index set at 100 for January 2019. It highlights various regions, including China, all emerging economies as a whole, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East, and Emerging Asia (excluding China).

Key Observations:
1. **China**: Exhibits a significant increase in industrial production, peaking well above the 120 mark by 2023 and continuing to show strong growth trends towards 2024.
2. **All Emerging Economies**: Follow a steady upward trajectory post-2020, surpassing the 100 index after a dip during the early months of the pandemic.
3. **Latin America and Africa and the Middle East**: Both regions experienced a sharp decline in early 2020, indicative of the COVID-19 pandemic impact, but have since recovered to hover around the base index (100) by 2022-2023.
4. **Emerging Asia (excluding China)**: Shows slower growth compared to China but maintains a steady increase from mid-2020, nearing the 100 base index line by 2023.

Overall, the data indicates that while all emerging economies have shown resilience and recovery post-pandemic, China's industrial production has surged ahead, making it the leader of the pack. This suggests robust economic activities in China and varying degrees of recovery and growth among other emerging regions.
