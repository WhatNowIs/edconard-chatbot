The provided figure displays the decomposition of inflation from January 2019 to July 2022 under a baseline calibration. Various factors contributing to inflation are visualized:

1. **Cross-sect. comp. (Cross-sectional comparison)**: Represented by blue bars.
2. **Inflation expect. (Inflation expectations)**: Represented by gray bars.
3. **Output gap**: Represented by orange bars.
4. **Fixed Core PCE**: Represented by yellow bars.
5. **Aggregate comp. (Aggregate comparison)**: Represented by green bars.
6. **CPI inflation**: Represented by an orange line that tracks the overall trend of inflation.

Key Observations:
- **Volatility during early 2020**: There is a notable dip around early 2020, closely associated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a sharp recovery.
- **Increased inflation from mid-2021 onwards**: A significant rise in inflation post-mid-2021, peaking in early 2022.
- **Stabilization attempts**: After peaking, inflation shows signs of stabilization or slight reduction by mid-2022.

Each component plays distinct roles over time, but collectively they illustrate the dynamics and changes in inflationary pressure over the observed period. The orange line (CPI inflation) acts as an aggregate indicator, showing the overall trend influenced by the various components.
