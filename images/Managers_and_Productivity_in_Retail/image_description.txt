The image displays Figure 7 titled "Event Study: Switching Bottom and Top Managers," which comprises two graphs depicting productivity over time for two companies, Company A and Company B. The graphs illustrate the effect of switching managers on log productivity, measured in months before and after the change in management.

Key elements of the graphs:

### (a) Productivity (Company A)
- **Blue Line (Top to Bottom)**: Represents coefficients for stores switching from top (above median) to bottom (below median) managers.
- **Red Line (Bottom to Top)**: Represents coefficients for stores switching from bottom (below median) to top (above median) managers.
- Whiskers indicate the 95% confidence intervals.

### (b) Productivity (Company B)
- **Blue Line (Top to Bottom)**: Similar configuration as in Company A for switches from top to bottom managers.
- **Red Line (Bottom to Top)**: Similar configuration as in Company A for switches from bottom to top managers.
- Whiskers indicate the 95% confidence intervals.

### Observations
- **Pre-Switch Period**: Productivity levels appear relatively stable in the months leading up to the management switch.
- **Post-Switch Period**:
  - **Bottom to Top (Red Line)**: Shows an improvement in log productivity post-switch.
  - **Top to Bottom (Blue Line)**: Generally shows a decline in productivity after the switch.

### Note:
- Dots represent the coefficient values, while whiskers denote the 95% confidence interval.
- The red lines in both graphs indicate positive productivity change for stores that switch from below-median to above-median managers.
- The blue lines in both graphs indicate negative productivity change for stores that switch from above-median to below-median managers.
- The study uses robust standard errors for these calculations.
