The image is a graph from CBO (Congressional Budget Office) showing the net immigration estimates by category from 2000 to 2024. It includes three categories of immigrants:

1. **Lawful Permanent Residents (+):** This includes lawful permanent residents (LPRs) and those who can apply for such status (e.g., refugees). This category shows a relatively consistent trend over the years, usually between 0.5 and 1 million people per year.

2. **INA Nonimmigrants:** These are nonimmigrants under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), such as students and temporary workers. Their numbers fluctuate more significantly but remain close to the baseline, generally not exceeding 0.5 million people.

3. **Other Nonimmigrants:** Also referred to as "other foreign nationals" by CBO, this category includes immigrants with a nonlegal or pending status. A dramatic increase is noticeable in this category around 2022, skyrocketing to around 2.5 million people by 2023. 

The graph highlights a notable surge in net immigration of "other nonimmigrants" in recent years, particularly in 2022 and 2023. The graph also includes the source of the data, CBO 2024, and has notes explaining the categories in detail. 

**Summary:** The image indicates a significant rise in net immigration of "other nonimmigrants" (including those with nonlegal or pending status) in 2022 and 2023, reaching an estimated 2.5 million people in 2023, as per CBO estimates. This contrasts with the more stable trend in lawful permanent residents and INA nonimmigrants over the years.
