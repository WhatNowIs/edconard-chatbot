The image illustrates a significant discrepancy between the official estimate of China's current account surplus and adjusted figures. The adjustments suggest that the actual surplus might be approximately 3.5 times the official estimate, indicating possibly large amounts of money leaving China covertly.

The graph titled "Chinese current account balance, 4q rolling sums (USD billions)" presents three lines:

1. **Official Estimates** (blue line)
2. **With GACC Goods Balance Adjustment** (red line)
3. **With GACC Goods Balance and Income Receipts Adjustment** (green line)

Key observations:
- From 1998 to around 2019, the official estimates and the adjustment with the GACC goods balance were relatively similar, with minor deviations.
- Post-2019, there is a noticeable widening gap between the official estimates and the figures incorporating the goods balance and income receipts adjustment.
- Around 2021, this gap becomes particularly pronounced, with the adjusted figures (green line) soaring far above the official estimates (blue line), reaching a peak significantly higher than previous years.

The asterisk note explains that the adjustments assume the yield on Chinese foreign assets increased in line with market interest rates since the fourth quarter of 2021. The source of the data is the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, General Administration of Customs (China), and the calculations are attributed to Matthew Klein.

In summary, the adjustments suggest the current account surplus is much higher than officially reported, hinting at substantial unrecorded outflows of capital from China.
