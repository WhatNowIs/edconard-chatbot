The image is a graph titled "Figure 2: Household saving rate and aggregate wealth-to-income ratio in the US from 1989 to 2019." It shows two distinct trends using different colored lines:

1. **Personal Saving Rate (blue line)**: This represents the percentage of personal savings relative to disposable personal income over the specified years. 

2. **Wealth to Disposable Personal Income Ratio (orange line)**: This shows the ratio of aggregate wealth to disposable personal income over the same period.

Key observations from the graph:

- The personal saving rate and wealth-to-disposable personal income ratio both exhibit fluctuations over the three decades.
- The personal saving rate has experienced several notable peaks, reaching around 10% on some occasions, particularly early in the period and around the Great Recession (2007-2009). It generally stays between 4% and 10%.
- The wealth-to-disposable personal income ratio shows an overall upward trend from 1989 to 2019, oscillating between 4.5 and 7.
- Around the early 2000s and after the 2008 financial crisis, significant dips in the personal savings rate are noticeable.
