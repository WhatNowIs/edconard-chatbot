The figure is titled "Sensitivity of interest rates to inflation news" and comprises two panels.

1. **Top Panel: Treasury Yields**
   - This graph shows the changes in the ten-year and two-year Treasury yields from 2014 to 2024 relative to core CPI inflation news.
   - The ten-year yield (in red) and the two-year yield (in teal) show fluctuations around 0% until around 2016 and again stabilize around 2020. 
   - Post-2022, a notable increase in both yields is observed.
   - The blue-shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals based on robust (White) standard errors.

2. **Bottom Panel: Futures Rates**
   - This graph depicts changes in various federal funds rate futures (ED2, ED4, ED6, ED8, ED12, ED16) relative to core CPI inflation news.
   - Each line represents a different future rate contract (with colors like red, green, blue, purple, etc.).
   - The coefficients start around -1 until 2016, rising to around 0 from 2017. 
   - Post-2022, similar to the Treasury yields, there is a notable upward trend across all contracts.
   - Blue-shaded areas again represent 95% confidence intervals based on robust (White) standard errors.

**Footnote Clarifications:**
- The coefficients are derived from rolling regressions of changes in Treasury yields (top) and federal funds rate futures (bottom) on core CPI news.
- Core CPI news is defined as the difference between released core CPI inflation and consensus expectations.
- The rolling windows use 24 monthly releases, with a sample period from January 2012 to May 2024.

**Summary:**
The figure illustrates how both Treasury yields and futures rates are sensitive to core CPI inflation news. Over the observed period from 2014 to 2024, both Treasury yields and futures rates show significant increases post-2022, indicating heightened sensitivity to inflation data during this later period.
