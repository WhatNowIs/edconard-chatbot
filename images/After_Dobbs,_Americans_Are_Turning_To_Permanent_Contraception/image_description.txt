This graph titled "Knotty decisions" provides data on monthly procedures for tubal ligation and vasectomy per 100,000 young adults with health-care appointments in the United States from 2018 to 2023. 

Key points:
1. The graph tracks the procedures among 18-to-30-year-olds seen in selected health facilities for outpatient appointments.
2. Two types of permanent contraception procedures are highlighted: tubal ligation and vasectomy.
3. The graph distinguishes the periods before and after the Dobbs decision. 
   - The Dobbs decision appears to be a significant event affecting the trend, marked in 2022.
   
Trends:
- **Tubal Ligation**: 
  - There is a noticeable increase in the number of procedures over time.
  - Pre-Dobbs trend line suggested a gradual increase from 2018 to mid-2022.
  - Post-Dobbs trend shows a sharp rise, reaching about 400 procedures per 100,000 young adults by 2023.
  
- **Vasectomy**:
  - The number of procedures shows a slower but steady increase over the same period.
  - Post-Dobbs decision, the trend accelerates slightly, reaching about 50 procedures per 100,000 young adults by 2023.

The data source is from a study titled “Changes in permanent contraception procedures among young adults following the Dobbs decision” by J. E. Ellison et al., 2024. The Dobbs decision seems to have influenced the trends observed in the graph, particularly causing a more pronounced increase in tubal ligations and a steady rise in vasectomies post-2022.
