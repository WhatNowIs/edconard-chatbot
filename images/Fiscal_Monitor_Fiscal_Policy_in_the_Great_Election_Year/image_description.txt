The image presents Figure 1.8 from a report, showing the impact of US long-term nominal interest rates on both advanced and emerging market economies. The data is visualized through graphs displaying the percentage point change over time, with predictions spanning from 0 to 37 months ahead.

Key Points:

1. **Advanced Economies (Left Graph):**
   - The median impact of a 1 percentage point spike in US long-term nominal interest rates rises sharply within the first 3 months, peaking around 0.8 percentage points.
   - Subsequently, the impact stabilizes and remains relatively constant around 0.8 percentage points through the 37-month period.
   - The 95 percent confidence interval, represented by the shaded area, shows a wider range initially which narrows over time, indicating growing predictability of the impact.

2. **Emerging Market Economies (Right Graph):**
   - The median impact also rises sharply within the first 3-5 months, peaking at approximately 1.2 percentage points.
   - The impact starts to decline gradually after peaking, reducing to around 0.7 percentage points after 37 months.
   - Unlike advanced economies, the 95 percent confidence interval for emerging markets is wider and stays relatively broad throughout the period, signifying greater uncertainty in the impact.

**Summary:**
The figure highlights the differing responses of advanced and emerging market economies to changes in US long-term nominal interest rates. Advanced economies exhibit a quick rise and stabilization in impact, with a more predictable response over time. In contrast, emerging market economies face a higher initial impact followed by a gradual decline, with a greater degree of uncertainty throughout the projection period. This analysis underscores the varying levels of economic sensitivity and predictability in response to US monetary policy shifts between advanced and emerging markets.
