The chart displays trends in the contributions to US wage bill growth, focusing on the displacement of workers from old roles and their reemployment in new roles. The data spans from 1950 to 2017, presented in percentage points with 10-year moving averages.

Here are the key observations:

1. **Reemployment of Workers in New Roles (Blue)**:
   - Initially, from 1950 to around 1985, reemployment contributed positively to wage bill growth, with values ranging between 0.3 to 0.7 percentage points.
   - Post-1985, there is a noticeable decline in reemployment contributions, though it remains positive. This trend continues to be relatively stable but lower through to 2017.

2. **Displacement of Workers from Old Roles (Red)**:
   - Displacement has been consistently negative in its contribution, reflecting job losses or shifts.
   - The downward trend becomes more significant from around the late 1970s and intensifies further in the years following the 2000s, with values around -0.5 to almost -1 percentage point.

3. **General Trend**:
   - Throughout the observed period, displacement of workers has risen relative to reemployment, indicating a growing difficulty in workers finding new roles after job losses.
   - This trend highlights increasing challenges in the labor market, where the negative impact of displacement on wage growth has been growing while the positive impact of reemployment has been diminishing or remained static.

**Conclusion**:
The chart underscores a growing imbalance in the labor market over the decades, where the adverse effects of job displacement have increasingly outweighed the benefits of reemployment in new roles. This dynamic suggests potential areas of concern for policymakers and stakeholders aiming to enhance labor market resilience and worker transition pathways.
