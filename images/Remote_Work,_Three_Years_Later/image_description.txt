The graph in Exhibit 1 illustrates the trend in the share of U.S. workers working at least partly remotely from May 2020 to May 2023. Key points include:

1. **Initial Surge in Remote Work**: At the start (May 2020), the percentage of workers working from home was notably high, reaching near 60% according to some estimates.
   
2. **Gradual Decline**: Since the peak in May 2020, there has been a steady decline in the proportion of employees working remotely. By May 2023, this proportion had reduced to around 20-25%, approximately half of its initial peak.

3. **Comparison Across Sources**: 
   - **WFH Research** indicates the percentage of days worked from home.
   - **IPSOS** reports the share of workers who worked from home or remotely in the last few weeks.
   - **CPS (Current Population Survey)** provides data on workers who teleworked or worked at home in the past four weeks.
   - **Goldman Sachs (GS) Estimate**: Offers an estimated average combining data from WFH Research, IPSOS, and CPS.

4. **Pre-Covid Baseline**: The pre-COVID average share of remote workers was about 2.6% (based on the American Community Survey), indicating a substantial increase in remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The takeaway is that while the number of remote workers remains significantly higher than the pre-COVID average, it has decreased substantially from the pandemic peak, stabilizing around 20-25%.
