This image contains four distinct charts, each comparing certain economic metrics for Durable Goods Manufacturing with the Aggregate Economy. Here are the main points for each chart:

1. **Productivity Growth (5yr, Ann):**
   - The chart shows the productivity growth rates for both Durable Goods Manufacturing and the Aggregate Economy from around 1975 to 2020.
   - There was a significant productivity boom in durable goods manufacturing from the 1980s to the early 2000s, which was largely driven by automation.
   - After the 2000s, productivity growth rates for both durable goods and the aggregate economy began to converge and stabilize.

2. **Domestic Output Prices (5yr, Ann):**
   - This chart displays the annual growth rates of domestic output prices for both sectors over the same time period.
   - From the late 1970s to around 2005, durable goods prices saw a significant decline, contrasting with relatively stable prices for the aggregate economy.
   - Post-2005, the output prices for durable goods started to rise again but remained generally below the aggregate economy's price levels.

3. **Real Output Growth (5yr, Ann):**
   - The chart measures the growth rates of real output.
   - There were pronounced spikes in the real output growth of durable goods manufacturing, specifically around the early 2000s, correlating with decreased prices and increased demand.
   - Growth rates for the aggregate economy were steadier and less volatile in comparison.

4. **Share of Consumer Spending:**
   - This chart illustrates the share of consumer spending allocated to durable goods from 1959 to 2020.
   - Despite fluctuations, the long-term trend shows a relatively stable or slightly declining share of consumer spending on durable goods.
   - This indicates that consumers did not allocate a significantly larger share of their wallets to goods consumption over the decades, even when prices declined.

### Summary:
Over the past few decades, durable goods manufacturing experienced a boom in productivity primarily due to automation, which contributed to a significant decline in output prices until around 2000. This period also saw jumps in real output growth as lower prices increased demand for durable goods. Despite these trends, the share of consumer spending on durable goods remained relatively stable or declined slightly. This suggests that consumers didn't shift significantly more of their spending towards these goods.
