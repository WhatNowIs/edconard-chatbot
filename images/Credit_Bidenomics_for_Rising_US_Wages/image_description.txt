The graph illustrates the real wages for the middle quintile (40th-60th percentile) using a 3-month moving average between 2014 and 2024, relative to December 2019.

### Key Observations:

1. **Pre-Pandemic Trends (2014-2019)**:
    - From 2014 to late 2019, real wages exhibited a gradual increase.

2. **Pandemic Impact (2020-2021)**:
    - The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a significant fluctuation in real wages.
    - In 2020, there was a sharp rise followed by a fall in real wages, attributed to composition effects where low-wage workers disproportionately lost jobs.
    - A notable recovery in real wages occurred in 2021 as those jobs were regained.

3. **Post-Pandemic Recovery and Growth (2021-2023)**:
    - Post-2021 period shows a substantial and steady increase in real wages.
    - By 2023, real wages for the middle quintile exceeded pre-pandemic levels and were also higher than expected based on pre-pandemic trends (2015-2019).

### Additional Information:
- The data is sourced from merged CPS ORG data (IPUMS) from January 2015 to December 2023, excluding imputed wages.
- Inflation adjustments follow the seasonally adjusted CPI-U.
- Earnings calculations are based on a 3-month moving average for hourly and salaried workers aged 16-65.

### Summary:
This graph highlights the real wage trajectory for middle-income earners, showing a consistent rise before the pandemic, a temporary spike and fall during the pandemic due to job losses among low-wage workers, and a robust recovery post-pandemic, with real wages surpassing pre-pandemic trends by 2023.
