The image is a line graph titled "Labor Force Participation Index for Women with Children," created by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The graph tracks changes in labor force participation from 2017 to early 2023, using February 2018 as the baseline (Index = 100). The data is sourced from the Current Population Survey and is based on the presence of a partner and the age of the youngest child in the household.

The graph distinguishes four groups:
1. Women with a partner and a young child (< 6 years old) - solid blue line
2. Women with a partner and an older child (6-17 years old) - dashed blue line
3. Single women with a young child (< 6 years old) - solid orange line
4. Single women with an older child (6-17 years old) - dashed orange line

Summary:

The graph illustrates fluctuations in labor force participation for women with children over the last several years, highlighting differences based on partnership status and the age of the youngest child. 

Key observations:
- Women with a partner and a young child (solid blue line) generally had the highest participation rates, often exceeding the baseline (Index = 100).
- Women with a partner and an older child (dashed blue line) showed more stable participation rates, slightly below the baseline.
- Single women with a young child (solid orange line) had the most volatile rates, frequently dropping below the baseline.
- Single women with an older child (dashed orange line) displayed considerable variability but were somewhat more stable than their counterparts with younger children.

The labor force participation for all groups saw significant dips around 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with varying recovery patterns in subsequent years.
