Sure, here's a summary based on the information provided in the image:

The image consists of two charts related to LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) infrastructure:

1. **Chart A: LNG fleets, new orders**
   - This chart shows the deadweight tonnage (DWT) of new LNG fleet orders from January 2020 to May 2022.
   - The chart indicates a significant upward trend in new LNG fleet orders over this period, with notable increases observed around early 2021 and mid-2022.
   - A dotted line marks the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, around which there's an evident growth in fleet orders.

2. **Chart B: LNG liquefaction terminals, added capacity**
   - This chart displays the additional capacity of LNG liquefaction terminals in million metric tons per annum (MTPA) from 2020 to a projected 2026.
   - The capacity remained relatively steady until 2022, after which there's a sharp increase projected for the years 2023, 2025, and 2026.
   - This indicates a significant investment in LNG infrastructure, with a notable surge anticipated between 2024 and 2026.

**Key Points:**
- There has been substantial growth in new LNG fleet orders, especially noticeable post the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
- Added capacity for LNG liquefaction terminals is expected to surge significantly from 2023 onwards, indicating efforts to expand LNG production capabilities in the coming years.
