The image consists of two sections: a line graph on the left and a bar chart on the right. Both illustrate the neutral rate of interest in relation to historical trends and projections.

### Summary:

**Line Graph (Federal Funds Rate from 1991 to 2023):**
1. **1991-2007 Average:** The average Federal Funds Rate during this period was approximately 4.2%, shown by a dashed red line.
2. **2008-2019 Average:** The average Federal Funds Rate during this period was significantly lower at around 0.6%, shown by another dashed red line.
3. The Federal Funds Rate experienced notable peaks around 1994, 2000, and slight peaks in the early 2010s. There were major lows around 2009 and 2021.
4. In recent years, the rate surged significantly again around 2023, indicating a rebound post-GFC (Global Financial Crisis) period.

**Bar Chart (Estimated Neutral or Long-Run Nominal Rate):**
1. **FOMC Estimate:** Approximately 2.5 percentage points.
2. **HLW Model Estimate:** Close to 3.5 percentage points.
3. **GS Estimate:** Around 3.75 percentage points.
4. **10y5y Forward Interest Rates:** Nearly 4.5 percentage points, the highest among the four estimates.

### Key Insights:
- The neutral rate, which balances economic growth and inflation, should be considerably higher post-GFC compared to the norm during the 2008-2019 period.
- Recent Federal Funds Rates around 2023 are aligning more closely with long-term neutral rate projections than the historically lower rates observed post-GFC.

The chart implies a consensus towards higher neutral rates in the future, contrasted with the unusually low rates experienced during the recovery period following the 2008 financial crisis.
