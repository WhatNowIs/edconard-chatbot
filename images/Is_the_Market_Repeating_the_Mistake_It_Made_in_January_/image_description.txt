The image presents a chart titled "CEOs are more and more bullish on the outlook," which tracks CEO business confidence over time. The chart spans from the year 2000 to 2024 and includes three index lines:

1. **Blue Line**: CEO Business Confidence in current economic conditions compared to six months ago.
2. **Gray/Orange Line**: CEO Business Confidence regarding expectations of business conditions in their own industry, six months ahead.

Key observations:

- Over the entire period, there are distinct peaks and troughs, indicating periods of higher and lower confidence.

- Post-2020, there has been a significant rebound in confidence, particularly notable in early 2021.
- As of 2024, the indices are on an upward trend, suggesting increasing optimism among CEOs regarding current and future economic and business conditions.

Overall, the chart demonstrates fluctuating but generally improving confidence among CEOs, with a notable recovery after major economic downturns.
