The image provides a graphical representation of the changes in global semiconductor manufacturing market share by location from 1990 to a forecasted 2030. The key points from the graph include:

1. **US Decline**: The US had a major share in 1990 but has experienced a significant decline over the years and is projected to represent a smaller portion by 2030.
2. **Taiwan and South Korea Rise**: Both Taiwan and South Korea have increased their market shares substantially from 1990 to 2020, with Taiwan leading a more significant share.
3. **China's Growth**: China, initially with a minimal share, has shown a steady rise in semiconductor manufacturing, projected to increase significantly by 2030.
4. **Japan and Europe**: Japan and Europe's shares in the market have decreased markedly since 1990.
5. **Other Regions**: The category labeled "Others" remains relatively minor throughout the period.

The chart effectively illustrates the shifting landscape of semiconductor manufacturing, highlighting the increasing prominence of Asian countries in this sector, while the US and other regions see a reduction in their dominance.
