The image displays a graph illustrating the clockwise movements of the jobless unemployment rate, with distinct patterns highlighted for November 2022 and the Great Recession. The x-axis represents the "Change in smoothed jobless rate (first derivative)," while the y-axis represents the "Change in change of jobless rate (second derivative)."

- **First Derivative**: Measures the change in the smoothed jobless rate.
- **Second Derivative**: Measures the change in the change of the smoothed jobless rate.

In the graph:

- The green trajectories depict movements in jobless rates, including for November 2022.
- The red trajectories are specific to the Great Recession period.
