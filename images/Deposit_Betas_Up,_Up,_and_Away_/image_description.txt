### Summary:
The charts illustrate that cumulative deposit betas, which reflect the sensitivity of banking industry interest expenses to changes in the federal funds rate, have been generally increasing across various interest-rate tightening cycles since 1995. The trend for both IB deposits and total deposits shows notable spikes during the 1999-2000 period, with steadier increases seen in the periods 2004-2007, 2015-2019, and the initial data for 2022. This implies a growing responsiveness of deposit interest expenses to federal fund rate changes over time.
