The image is a scatter plot labeled "Figure 3A: Relationship between Aging and Per Capita GDP Growth". The plot examines the relationship between the growth rate in the percentage of the population aged 60 and above (x-axis) and the growth rate in per capita GDP (y-axis).

Key features include:
- Each circle represents a state, with the size of the circles reflecting the state's population size.
- A negative correlation is indicated by the downward-sloping regression line with a slope of -1.670.
- Larger population states generally have a wider range of aging percentages and GDP growth rates.
  
The graph suggests that as the percentage of the elderly population (aged 60+) increases, the growth rate in per capita GDP tends to decrease, as indicated by the negative slope of the regression line. The data points are scattered, but there is a discernible trend aligned with the regression line.
