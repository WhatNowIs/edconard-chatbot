The image presents data on the share of disposable income that households in the U.S. have spent on food over the past three decades, as sourced from the Agriculture Department. The information is conveyed through two line graphs.

1. **All Food:**
   - The left graph shows the trend in the percentage of disposable income spent on all food from 1990 to 2020.
   - The share of income spent on food has generally been decreasing, starting at about 11% in 1990 and declining to under 10% in the 2010s.
   - A notable spike is observed around the year 2020, where the percentage jumps significantly, reaching a three-decade high of just under 12%.

2. **Groceries vs. Dining Out:**
   - The right graph breaks down food spending into two categories: groceries and dining out, as a percentage of disposable income.
   - Between 1990 and ~2010, the share of income spent on groceries declines substantially from about 7% to around 5%, then stabilizes.
   - Meanwhile, spending on dining out remains fairly constant around 4% until the mid-2010s when it begins to increase slightly.
   - Around 2020, there is a pronounced convergence, with spending on dining out dropping sharply and grocery spending increasing, coinciding with notable shifts observed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In summary, overall food spending hit a three-decade high in 2020. While grocery spending had been in decline, dining out spending remained relatively stable until the pandemic, when major shifts in consumer behavior led to increased grocery spending and decreased dining out.
