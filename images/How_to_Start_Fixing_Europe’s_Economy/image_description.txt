### Summary of US and EU Economic Differences

This graphic illustrates the historical economic differences between the United States (US) and the European Union (EU) from 2000 to 2022 across several key metrics: GDP, GDP per head, GDP per working-age population, working age employment, GDP per person employed, and GDP per hour worked. Positive values indicate the EU figures are higher, whereas negative values show US figures are higher.

**1. **GDP:**
  - Initially, the EU had a slight advantage in GDP around the year 2000. 
  - However, the gap quickly turned negative around 2005, indicating the US's higher GDP.
  - This trend persists and deepens through 2022.

**2. **GDP per head:**
  - The US has consistently had a higher GDP per head compared to the EU. 
  - The gap grew more pronounced over the years, particularly from 2005 onward, with the EU lagging further behind the US.

**3. **GDP per working-age population:**
  - Similar to GDP per head, the EU consistently trails the US in GDP per working-age population.
  - The gap widens significantly from 2005 and continues to grow through 2022.

**4. **Working-age employment:**
  - The EU generally had lower working-age employment rates compared to the US, except for a brief period around 2010 where it saw a positive gap.
  - Over time, the negative gap widened, indicating higher working-age employment in the US.

**5. **GDP per person employed:**
  - The gap consistently shows that GDP per person employed is higher in the US compared to the EU.
  - This difference has widened notably from 2005 onwards, continuing through 2022.

**6. **GDP per hour worked:**
  - Although there is a persistent negative gap indicating that the US has higher GDP per hour worked, the difference fluctuates less dramatically compared to other metrics.

Overall, this data provides a clear indication of the economic disparities between the US and the EU, with the US maintaining higher performance metrics in GDP, productivity, and employment over the past two decades.
