The table, titled "Trends in CEO and Executive Characteristics," presents average factor scores for CEO candidates across different subsamples. The data is divided into two main subsamples: early (assessments before 2009) and late (assessments in or after 2009). It also separates the factor scores based on whether candidates were hired or not.

Key points:

1. **Subsamples**: 
   - Early assessments (before 2009)
   - Late assessments (after 2009)

2. **Factor Scores**:
   - Four factors are considered.
   - Scores are shown for all candidates, as well as for hired candidates, in each subsample.

3. **Statistical Tests**:
   - **A=0**: Tests if factor scores for all assessed candidates are zero.
   - **E=L**: Tests if early and late subsample factor scores are equal.
   - **H=N**: Tests if factor scores for hired and non-hired candidates are equal.
   - **E=L among Hired**: Tests if early and late subsample factor scores are equal among hired candidates.

4. **Statistical Significance**:
   - Indicated with stars (*** for 1%, ** for 5%, * for 10% p-levels).
   
5. **Observations**:
   - Total observations in each column are listed at the bottom of the table (1,299 total candidates).

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Factor 1**:
   - Overall factor score is 0.09, significantly different from zero.
   - Early: 0.18; Late: 0.00 (difference significant).
   - Hired: 0.18 (significantly different from non-hired, which is not shown).

2. **Factor 2**:
   - Overall factor score is -0.11, significantly different from zero.
   - Early: -0.06; Late: -0.16 (difference significant).
   - Hired: -0.07 (marginally different from non-hired).

3. **Factor 3**:
   - Overall factor score is -0.24, significantly different from zero.
   - Early: -0.38; Late: -0.12 (difference significant).
   - Hired: -0.30 (significantly different from non-hired).

4. **Factor 4**:
   - Overall factor score is 0.17, significantly different from zero.
   - Early: 0.29; Late: 0.06 (difference significant).
   - Hired: 0.24 (significantly different from non-hired).

Overall, the table indicates significant differences in factor scores based on time periods and hiring status, suggesting changing trends and criterion for CEO candidate assessments over time.
