The image shows two yellow pencils placed against a white background. The pencils are of the same style, characterized by their yellow bodies, pink erasers, and gold ferrules, but they differ significantly in length. 

- The pencil on the left is full-length, appearing unused or lightly used, with a sharp point indicating readiness for writing.
- The pencil on the right is much shorter, indicative of extensive use. It also has a sharp point, suggesting it has been recently sharpened despite its reduced size.

In summary, the image contrasts a new, full-length yellow pencil with a heavily used, much shorter one, both showcasing their readiness to write through their sharp points.
