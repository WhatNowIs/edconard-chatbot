The provided image displays a graph comparing three different indexes over time from 1982 to 2022. Here's a detailed summary of the information extracted:

- **Indexes Displayed**:
  - **S&P 500 Index** (green line): This represents the performance of the S&P 500, which is a stock market index.
  - **Rational Benchmark Index (\( p_t^* \))** (blue line): Calculated from Equation (3), this index likely represents a theoretically derived benchmark.
  - **Benchmark Price Index Based on Earnings Expectations (\( \hat{p_t} \))** (red line): Calculated from Equation (4), this index bases its values on projected earnings.

- **Adjustment**:
  - All values in the graph are adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

- **Timeframe**:
  - The data spans from 1982 to 2022, capturing a 40-year period.

- **Visual Analysis**:
  - The S&P 500 (green line) shows significant fluctuations over the years, including notable peaks around 2000 (dot-com bubble), 2008 (financial crisis), and a steady rise post-2012.
  - The rational benchmark index (blue line) appears to follow an upward trend with fewer fluctuations compared to the S&P 500.
  - The benchmark price index based on earnings expectations (red line) seems to closely follow the S&P 500 while smoothing out some of the volatility.
