The provided image consists of two graphs focused on different aspects of energy consumption in the United States. Here is a summary of each graph:

1. **US Energy Dependence and Independence (Left Graph)**:
   - This graph shows the net imports of oil, natural gas, and coal as a share of total primary energy consumption from 1970 to around 2020.
   - Initially, in the 1970s, the US was a net importer, with net imports peaking above 30%.
   - There were fluctuations over the decades, with peaks around the early 80s and late 2000s.
   - A significant decline is observed post-2006, shifting towards energy independence.
   - By around 2019, the US transitioned to being a net exporter, with net imports decreasing below 0%.

2. **Oil Intensity and Consumption (Right Graph)**:
   - This graph presents oil intensity (measured in megajoules per US dollar of GDP, chained to 2017 dollars) and global 5-year rolling oil demand growth from 1965 to approximately 2020.
   - US oil intensity shows a sharp decline from around 6 MJ/US$ in the late 1960s to less than 2 MJ/US$ by 2015, indicating improved energy efficiency over time.
   - Global 5-year rolling oil demand growth percentage (shown on the right y-axis) fluctuates, with clear cycles of positive and negative growth rates.
   - A noticeable decline in global oil demand growth is evident in the mid-1980s and around the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, while recent years show global demand growth hovering close to 0%.

Overall, these graphs highlight a significant trend towards energy independence in the US, coupled with increased efficiencies in oil usage relative to economic output, and a slowing global demand growth for oil over time.
