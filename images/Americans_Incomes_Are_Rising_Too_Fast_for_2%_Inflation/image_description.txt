**Summary:**

The image showcases a line graph depicting the percentage change in total private-sector wage and salary income per month since January 2022. The graph illustrates two lines: an old estimate and a revised new estimate.

**Key Insights:**
- **Old Estimate**: It was previously assumed that private-sector wages and salaries were growing at an annualized rate of 5.8% in the second half of 2022 (2022H2).
- **New Estimate**: Revised data indicates that earnings have been rising at a much higher rate, approximately 10% per year.

**Graph Details:**
- The graph spans from January 2022 to January 2023.
- The new estimate line displays a consistent upward trend, peaking near 9% by January 2023.
- The old estimate line depicts a slower and more gradual increase, peaking closer to 6% by the same period.
