The provided chart, titled "Fewer but busier," showcases changes in the number of abortion facilities and abortions in the United States from April 2022, split between states where abortion was banned or restricted and states where it remained permitted. The timelines cover from May 2022 to February 2023, with a significant marker denoting the "Dobbs decision," which likely refers to a major legal decision impacting abortion laws.

- Post-Dobbs decision, states where abortion was banned or restricted saw a substantial decrease in the number of facilities, dropping to as low as -60 by mid-2023.
- In contrast, states where abortion remained permitted saw an increase, though the changes were relatively modest.

**Abortions (in thousands):**
- Following the Dobbs decision, the number of abortions in states where it was banned or restricted decreased significantly, with reductions reaching up to -15,000 by the end of 2022.
- Conversely, states where abortion remained permitted experienced a rise in the number of abortions, with an increase of up to 10,000 by early 2023.

In summary, the Dobbs decision led to a considerable decline in the number of abortion facilities and abortions in states with bans or restrictions, while states where abortion remained legal saw slight growth in facilities and a notable increase in abortions.
