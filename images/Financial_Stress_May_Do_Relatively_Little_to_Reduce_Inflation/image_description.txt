The chart depicted compares the impacts of financial stress and monetary tightening on the unemployment rate and CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation over a period of 36 months since the inception of these conditions.

Key Points:

1. **Unemployment Rate**:
   - **Financial Stress**: Increases gradually, peaking at around a 0.7 percentage point rise approximately 18 months after the onset, then declines towards 36 months.
   - **Monetary Tightening**: Increases similarly but peaks around a 1.0 percentage point rise slightly earlier, then declines slightly faster after the peak.

2. **CPI Inflation**:
   - Both financial stress and monetary tightening initially cause a decrease in CPI inflation.
   - **Monetary Tightening**: Causes a steeper and more pronounced decline in inflation, reaching nearly -0.8 percent around 12 months after onset before gradually increasing towards -0.4 percent by month 36.
   - **Financial Stress**: Leads to a lesser decline, bottoming near -0.2 percent and stabilizing around this level through 36 months.

Conclusion:
Historically, financial stress and monetary tightening both lead to increased unemployment, with monetary tightening showing a slightly more significant impact. On inflation, monetary tightening has a stronger disinflationary effect compared to financial stress.
