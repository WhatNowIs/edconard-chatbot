The chart "Paid back with interest" from The Economist depicts the percentage of global interest costs as a share of GDP from 2016, with forecasts up to 2027. Key takeaways include:

1. **Interest Rate Projections**:
    - The chart tracks a baseline or "current rate path" and an alternative scenario with an additional 1 percentage point increase in interest rates in 2023.
    - The "current rate path" shows gradual increases in interest costs.
    - The alternative scenario shows a steep rise in interest costs, peaking significantly higher than the baseline.

2. **Data Coverage**:
    - The analysis covers 58 economies, accounting for 90% of the world's GDP.
    - It assumes constant debt-to-income ratios with private debt rolling over in two years and public debt in five years.

3. **Forecast Period**:
    - The forecast period begins in 2023 and extends to 2027.

4. **Key Sources**:
    - Data and estimates are sourced from Bloomberg, the International Institute of Finance (IIF), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations (UN), and The Economist itself.

This summary provides an understanding of potential future scenarios in global interest costs as a percentage of GDP, factoring in changes in interest rates.
