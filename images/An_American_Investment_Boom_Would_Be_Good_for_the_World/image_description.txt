The image illustrates the contributions to changes in real U.S. business investment in industrial equipment from Q1 2002 to the present, measured in 2012 USD billions on an annualized basis. The data is broken down into two categories: "Other" and "Special industry machinery, n.e.c. (includes semiconductor manufacturing equipment)."

Key points include:
- An overall trend indicating that inflation-adjusted capital spending on industrial equipment has increased by approximately 9% compared to pre-pandemic levels.
- A significant rise in spending attributed to "special industry machinery" since 2019, which is up by 55%.
- The bar chart shows variations over time with notable dips during the early 2000s and the 2008 financial crisis, followed by periods of growth.
- The recent surge in investment is strongly influenced by the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

This pattern signifies the heightened importance of the semiconductor industry in driving industrial equipment investment, particularly in the post-pandemic economic landscape.
