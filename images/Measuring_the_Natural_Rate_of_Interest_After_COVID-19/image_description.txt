Figure 5 is a set of graphs illustrating HLW (Holston-Laubach-Williams) estimates of key latent variables for the United States, Canada, and the Euro Area. The three key variables depicted are:

1. **COVID-adjusted Output Gap**
2. **Trend Growth**
3. **r\***

These variables are shown for two different model adjustments:
- **COVID-adjusted Model (blue lines)**
- **Model with parameters fixed at 2019:Q4 values (gold lines)**

### Key Observations:

#### United States:
1. **Output Gap**: The COVID-adjusted model shows significant fluctuations around 2020, indicating a large deviation due to the COVID-19 shock. Post-2020, there is a notable recovery.
2. **Trend Growth**: There is a steadily declining trend in growth from the 1960s to 2020, after which a sharp drop and recovery are observed.
3. **r\***: The natural rate of interest has been decreasing since the 1960s with a steep fall around 2020.

#### Canada:
1. **Output Gap**: Similar to the U.S., the output gap shows considerable volatility during the COVID-19 period, followed by a recovery.
2. **Trend Growth**: Trend growth has been on a decline since the 1960s with a pronounced dip around 2020.
3. **r\***: There's a consistent decline in the natural rate of interest, dropping sharply around 2020.

#### Euro Area:
1. **Output Gap**: The COVID-adjusted model reflects significant negative output gaps in the early 2020s, consistent with the global pandemic impact.
2. **Trend Growth**: Trend growth has been declining more mildly compared to the U.S. and Canada but shows the same sharp drop around 2020.
3. **r\***: The natural rate of interest has fluctuated but generally decreased over time, with a sharp decline around 2020.

### Notes:
- **Gold Lines** represent the model with parameters fixed at 2019:Q4 values, estimating the variables using data through 2022:Q4 but without adjusting for the COVID-19 impact.
- **Blue Lines** or the **COVID-adjusted model**, show the full-sample estimates of the modified HLW model, capturing the COVID-19 pandemic's impact.

This visualization highlights the economic shocks and recovery phases these regions experienced due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of adjusting models dynamically to account for unprecedented events.
