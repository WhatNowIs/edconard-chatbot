This image provides a comparative analysis of water inflow and outflow for the aquifer system under Phoenix, focusing on two time periods: 1900-2021 and 2022-2121. 

### Key Points

#### Inflow
- **1900-2021 Inflow:**
  - Water recharge.
  - Stream leakage.
  - Other sources.
  
- **2022-2121 Inflow (Projected):**
  - Water recharge.
  - Stream leakage.
  - Other sources.

#### Outflow
- **1900-2021 Outflow:** 
  - Stream leakage.
  - Evaporation.
  - Pumping.
  - Other sources.
  - Resulted in a loss of 168K acre-feet of aquifer storage each year.

- **2022-2121 Outflow (Projected):**
  - Pumping.
  - Evaporation.
  - Other sources.
  - Projected to result in a greater loss of 387K acre-feet of aquifer storage each year.

### Conclusion
The projection for the next century suggests that the aquifer system under Phoenix will lose more water than it did in the previous century, with a significant increase in water outflow primarily due to pumping. The net loss of aquifer storage is projected to be over twice as much, illustrating a concerning trend for water sustainability in the region.
