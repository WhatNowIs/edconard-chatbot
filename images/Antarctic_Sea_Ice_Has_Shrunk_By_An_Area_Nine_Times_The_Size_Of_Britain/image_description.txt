The chart titled "A thaw point" shows Antarctic sea-ice extent anomalies, depicting their variation from a 1981-2010 baseline in million square kilometers over the course of a year. The graph contrasts the 2023 data (red line) with data from the past two decades (2001-2022, represented by blue lines).

### Summary:
- **Anomalies**: The data illustrates how the sea-ice extent in the Antarctic region deviates from the 1981-2010 average.
- **Timeframe**: The horizontal axis represents months from January (J) to December (D).
- **Data Comparison**:
  - **2023 Data (Red Line)**: Shows a significant decrease in sea-ice extent, reaching much lower levels than any other year within the 2001-2022 range.
  - **2001-2022 Data (Blue Lines)**: Demonstrates typical fluctuations around the baseline, maintaining relatively consistent variations year over year.
- **Notable Points**:
  - By mid-year (June to September), the 2023 sea-ice extent anomaly has dipped considerably lower compared to previous years.
  - Other years show cyclical variations but remain within a narrower band around the baseline, unlike 2023's pronounced decline.
- **Source**: The data is sourced from the National Snow and Ice Data Centre.

This chart effectively illustrates the unusual and alarming reduction in Antarctic sea ice extent in 2023 compared to the past two decades, signaling potential climate anomalies or changes.
