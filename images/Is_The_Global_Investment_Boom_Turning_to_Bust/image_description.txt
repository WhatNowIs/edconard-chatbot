The image is a line chart titled "Going, going..." from The Economist, depicting the annual percentage change in non-residential fixed investment in the United States from 1991 to 2023. The chart visualizes two lines:

1. **Capex tracker:** A high-frequency measure of capital investment, shown in light blue.
2. **Non-residential fixed investment:** Shown in dark blue, indicating the broader trend.

Key observations:
- Both metrics show considerable volatility over the period.
- The Capex tracker (light blue) seems to react more quickly and with greater volatility compared to non-residential fixed investment (dark blue).
- Notable dips are observed around the early 2000s, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
- Peaks generally precede each dip, indicating a cyclical nature of investment activity.

The data sources for this chart include the Bureau of Economic Analysis and Goldman Sachs. The volatility highlighted in this chart emphasizes the cyclical and fluctuating nature of non-residential fixed investments in the US over the last three decades.
