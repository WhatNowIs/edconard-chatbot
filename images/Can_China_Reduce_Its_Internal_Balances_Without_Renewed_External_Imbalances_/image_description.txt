The provided graph illustrates the contribution of China's goods and services trade to GDP growth compared to changes in its manufacturing balance from 2000 to 2022. 

### Key Points:

1. **Manufacturing Balance (Gray Bars):**
   - Throughout the early 2000s, the manufacturing balance showed an upward trend, peaking around 2007-2008.
   - A significant decline took place during the global financial crisis in 2008-2009.
   - Post-crisis, the manufacturing balance recovered and remained relatively stable with moderate fluctuations.

2. **Net Export of Goods and Services (Red Line):**
   - The net export of goods and services was positive but fluctuating in the early 2000s.
   - During 2008-2009, there was a sharp decline, falling below zero, indicating a negative contribution to GDP growth.
   - Recovery began around 2010, with positive but varied contributions in the subsequent years, peaking again around 2021-2022.

### Summary:
From 2000 to 2022, China's trade in goods and services has contributed variably to its GDP growth. The manufacturing balance experienced a significant boost until the 2008 financial crisis, followed by stable but fluctuating growth. Net exports mirrored this pattern, with a notable dip during the crisis but showing positive contributions to GDP in most post-crisis years, peaking by 2021-2022.
