The image presents data from a WSJ/NORC poll conducted between March 1-13, 2023, involving 1,019 adults. It highlights the percentage of individuals in two age groups (18-29 and 65+) who consider certain values to be "very important" to them personally.

Key findings include:

1. **Patriotism**:
   - 36 percentage points difference between the two age groups.

2. **Having children**:
   - 9 percentage points difference between the two age groups.

3. **Religion**:
   - 24 percentage points difference between the two age groups.

4. **Hard work**:
   - 14 percentage points difference between the two age groups.

The data suggests that older individuals (65+) are more likely to place higher importance on these values compared to younger individuals (18-29). The highest contrast is observed in patriotism and religion. The margin of error for the poll is +/- 4.1 percentage points.
