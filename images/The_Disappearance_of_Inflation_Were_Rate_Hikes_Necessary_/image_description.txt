The image presents a line graph that depicts the annual percentage change in the US GDP Implicit Price Deflator alongside inflation expectations from 1970 to 2023. The inflation expectations are based on the Survey of Professional Forecasters. Here is a summary of the key points:

1. **Trends Over Time:**
   - Both inflation (red line) and inflation expectations (blue line) peaked in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, reaching levels above 10%.
   - The early 1980s showed a significant decline in both metrics, which remained relatively high but decreasing until the mid-1980s.
   - From the mid-1980s to early 1990s, both lines showed a noticeable downward trend, reaching lower and more stable levels by the late 1990s.
   - Between 2000 and 2020, inflation and expectations appear closely aligned and relatively stable, with occasional small fluctuations.
   - The graph shows another significant spike in both inflation and expectations around 2022.

2. **Key Periods:**
   - **1970-1982:** High volatility with significant peaks in inflation and expectations.
   - **1983-1994:** Gradual decline and stabilization of both metrics.
   - **1995-2019:** This period shows moderate and stable inflation and expectations.
   - **2020-2023:** A notable increase in both metrics, with a peak around 2022.

3. **Correlation:**
   - There is a visible correlation between inflation expectations and actual inflation over the years, although at some points the expectations lead or lag slightly behind actual inflation.

The graph effectively illustrates the historical changes in US inflation and how professional forecasters' expectations have generally tracked actual inflation, with major peaks during periods of economic stress and more stable periods during times of economic stability.
