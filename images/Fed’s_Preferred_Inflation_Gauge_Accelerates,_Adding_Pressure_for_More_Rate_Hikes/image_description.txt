The graphic from Bloomberg, using data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, illustrates the reacceleration of key US inflation gauges and a surge in spending. 

Key Points:
1. **Inflation Gauges**:
   - The chart tracks the year-over-year change in two inflation measures:
     - Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index (black line)
     - PCE Price Index excluding food and energy (red line)

2. **Recent Trends**:
   - As of the latest data point, the PCE Price Index has increased by 5.38% year-over-year.
   - The PCE Price Index minus food and energy has risen by 4.71% year-over-year.
   - Both measures have reaccelerated recently, especially notable from December 2022 to January 2023, as indicated by the green circled area.

3. **Spending Patterns**:
   - The bar graph beneath the inflation lines shows the month-over-month change in inflation-adjusted spending.
   - Spending saw a notable surge in March 2021 and December 2022.
   - The most recent data reflects a significant uptick in spending in January 2023.

Summary:
The graph illustrates a reacceleration of US inflation metrics with both the overall PCE Price Index and the core PCE Index (excluding food and energy) increasing significantly. These changes coincide with a surge in inflation-adjusted consumer spending, particularly in late 2022 and early 2023. The increase in spending suggests heightened economic activity, which might be contributing to the persistently high inflation rates.
