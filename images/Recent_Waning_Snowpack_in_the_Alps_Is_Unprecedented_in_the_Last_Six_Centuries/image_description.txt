The image provides an in-depth analysis of the duration of yearly snow cover in the Alps, reconstructed from tree ring-width data and supported by local temperature and precipitation records derived from instrumental data. The analysis demonstrates changes in snow cover over an extensive period, from the 1400s through the early 2000s.

**Summary:**

1. **Figure Structure:** 
   - **Figure 2a** (main panel): Shows the snow cover duration starting from 1400 CE. This graph highlights:
        - High year-to-year variability.
        - Instances of extreme snowpack duration both long-lasting and early-melting.
        - A overall stable trend until the 20th century, where a sharp decline is observed.
        - This trend is represented through various lines: black (yearly reconstruction), green dashed (50-year spline filter), and orange (piecewise linear regression). The shaded grey band indicates the uncertainty range (Â±2 root mean square error).
   - **Figure 2b** (inset): Focuses on the common period from 1834 to 2018. It compares the tree ring-width reconstruction (black), modelled snow cover duration (blue), and instrumental data (red). A key highlight here is:
        - Close agreement between instrumental and modelled records from the late 19th century onward.
        - Another significant downturn in snow cover duration towards the modern era.

2. **Overall Findings:**
   - The data shows that snow cover duration has been relatively stable from 1400 until the early 20th century.
   - There is a clear, sharp decline in snow cover duration within the last century, marked by increasing temperatures and potentially changing precipitation patterns.
   - This recent reduction in snow duration is stated to be unprecedented in the last six centuries.

The study thus highlights the significant impact of recent climatic changes on snowpack duration, underlining concerns about future snow cover in the Alps.
