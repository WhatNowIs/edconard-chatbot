Key Insights:
- Across all three periods, a negative change in longer-run neutral rates was observed in 1995-2007, while there was a slight positive change in the 2008-19 and a more significant positive change in 2020-22.
- Debt supply had a negative impact in 1995-2007, but switched to a significant positive impact in 2008-19 and continued positively in 2020-22.
- Safe asset demand notably decreased from 1995-2007 to a negligible impact in 2008-19, turning slightly positive in 2020-22.
- Productivity showed minimal impact in the early periods but became significantly positive in 2020-22.
- Demographics started with little to no effect in 1995-2007, turned negative in 2008-19, and remained slightly negative in 2020-22.
- Global spillovers consistently had a negative impact across all periods, though diminishing over time.
- Other factors were consistently negatively impacting the longer-run neutral rates in the first two periods, stabilizing to no impact in 2020-22.

This table overall reflects the evolving influences of various economic factors on the changes in longer-run neutral rates in the United States over different periods.
