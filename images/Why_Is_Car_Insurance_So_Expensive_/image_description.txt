The provided graph illustrates the year-over-year changes in Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures for motor vehicle insurance compared to overall inflation from 2017 to 2024.

Key observations:

1. **Motor Vehicle Insurance**:
   - Experienced moderate fluctuations until mid-2019.
   - Saw a sharp decline in 2020, with the rate dropping below -10%.
   - Displayed a steep recovery beginning around mid-2020, peaking above +15% in 2021.
   - Continued to rise consistently from early 2021 onwards, reaching above +20% by 2024.

2. **Overall Inflation**:
   - Maintained a relatively steady and low variance pattern throughout the period.
   - Experienced minor dips and rises but generally hovered close to 0%, representing a stable trend.
   - Inflation saw some slight increases post-2021 but remained within a narrow range compared to motor vehicle insurance.

The data suggest that while overall inflation remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, motor vehicle insurance costs have been highly volatile, especially with significant spikes post-2020. The graph emphasizes the significant disparity in the rate of change between the two measures.
