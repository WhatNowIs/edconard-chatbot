The image consists of two graphs depicting natural rate estimates (in percentage) for the United States (A) and the Euro area (B) from 1993 to 2023.

### United States (Graph A)
- **Sources/Estimates**:
  - Del Negro et al DSGE
  - Holston-Laubach-Williams
  - Hördahl-Tristani
  - Lubik-Matthes
  - Survey

- **Trends**:
  - All estimates show a general decline from the early 1990s, reaching a significant low around 2008 (coinciding with the financial crisis).
  - Post-2008, some variability is observed, with a slight upward trend moving towards 2023.
  - The estimates converge more closely in the later years, hovering around the 0-2% range.

### Euro Area (Graph B)
- **Sources/Estimates**:
  - Del Negro et al DSGE
  - Holston-Laubach-Williams
  - Hördahl-Tristani
  - Lubik-Matthes
  - Survey

- **Trends**:
  - Estimates start relatively high in the early 1990s and show a decline towards the mid-2000s.
  - Significant dips and volatility are observed around the 2008 financial crisis, similar to the US.
  - Post-2008 shows continued variability with estimates often falling below zero.
  - An upward trend is noticeable as they move closer to 2023, converging around the zero percent line.

### Conclusion
Both the US and Euro area natural rate estimates show a significant decline around the 2008 financial crisis, with variations across different estimations. Post-crisis, there's a visible effort to climb back to positive territory with slight upward trends observed closer to 2023. The data provides a clear depiction of the similarities and differences in the economic conditions and expectations between the two regions over the specified period.
