The image is a graph titled "Figure 1.4. Evolution of Public Debt in the Two Giants: The United States and China (Percent of GDP)." It illustrates the historical and projected public debt as a percentage of GDP for the United States and China from 2000 to 2053.

### Key Points:
- **Historical Data (2000-2023):**
  - The United States and China both show an increasing trend in public debt over the years.
  - Significant events marked on the graph like the global financial crisis (around 2008) and COVID-19 (around 2020) contributed to visible spikes in the debt levels of both countries.

- **Projected Data (2024-2053):**
  - Public debt for both countries is projected to continue rising. 
  - By 2053, the debt for the United States is projected to exceed 200% of GDP, whereas China's debt is projected to be around 150% of GDP.

### Sources and Notes:
- The data is sourced from IMF 2024, US Congressional Budget Office 2024, and IMF staff calculations.
- **United States:**
  - The figure reflects federal debt held by the public under unchanged policies.
- **China:**
  - The figure shows augmented debt including activities of local government financing vehicles (LGFVs), government guided funds, and special construction funds.
  - Projections do not include certain categories of local government financing vehicles' debt identified as "possible to be recognized debt" and debt tied to specific construction and government-guided funds.

### Projection Notes:
- For the United States, projections assume unchanged policies over the forecast horizon.
- For China, projections reflect the IMF staff's baseline scenario.

The graph and accompanying notes highlight the growing public debt challenge that both countries face, emphasizing different contributing factors and assumptions in their projections.
