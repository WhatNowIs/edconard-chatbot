The chart displays the relationship between Treasuries Outstanding and Daily Volumes (in trillions of dollars) from 2002 to 2023 (Year-To-Date). Here are the key points:

- **Outstanding Treasuries (Green Solid Line)**: This represents the total amount of Treasuries outstanding. The chart shows a steady increase in the total outstanding Treasuries, which has escalated significantly from around $5 trillion in 2008 to approximately $26 trillion by 2023.
  
- **Average Daily Volume (Green Dotted Line)**: This indicates the average daily trading volume in Treasuries, which has seen a moderate increase over the same period, peaking at around $0.12 trillion by 2023.

- **Volume as a Percentage of Outstanding (Black Dotted Line)**: This shows the average daily trading volume as a percentage of the total outstanding Treasuries. It significantly decreased from around 0.12 in 2008 to less than 0.04 in 2023.

The chart suggests that although average daily trading volumes have increased slightly, the overall volume as a percentage of outstanding Treasuries has drastically decreased, highlighting that the growth in the total stock of Treasuries far outpaces the growth in daily trading volumes. This trend indicates a substantial rise in the federal debt outstanding relative to the trading volume.
