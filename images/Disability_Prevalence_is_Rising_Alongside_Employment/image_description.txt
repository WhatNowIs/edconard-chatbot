This chart titled "Cognitive difficulties have become notably more prevalent" illustrates the change in the share of the population experiencing serious difficulties with various disabilities due to physical, mental, or emotional conditions. The data spans from 2017 to early 2023 and shows the change in percentage points from February 2020 levels. 

Key disability types considered include:
- Hearing (3.4%)
- Seeing (1.7%)
- Concentrating, remembering, or making decisions (3.8%)
- Walking or climbing stairs (6.9%)
- Dressing or bathing (2.1%)
- Doing errands alone (4.2%)

Main observations:
1. "Concentrating, remembering, or making decisions" saw a substantial increase, especially from 2022 onwards.
2. "Hearing" and "Doing errands alone" also showed a noticeable upward trend post-2020.
3. There is variability and seasonal fluctuations observed in most disability types throughout the period.
4. Disabilities involving physical movement, like "Walking or climbing stairs" and "Dressing or bathing," exhibited some fluctuation but less drastic increases compared to cognitive disabilities.

This data comes from the Current Population Survey with the author's calculations, and the lines represent a three-month moving average of the share reporting each type of disability. The estimates are not seasonally adjusted. The chart suggests that cognitive impairments have become more prevalent than physical disabilities over the recent years.
