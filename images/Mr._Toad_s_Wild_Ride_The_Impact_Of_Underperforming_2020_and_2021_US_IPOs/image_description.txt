The provided image includes three key sections showing net returns of IPOs by vintage year, the distribution of net returns, and the impact of removing the top percentages of IPOs on returns. Here is a breakdown summary:

### 1. Net Returns by Year (All Sectors)
- Excludes SPACs, includes IPOs greater than $50 million, holds for 2 years, and compares against S&P Small Cap Growth.
- **Average Net Returns (Red Line):**
  - Fluctuate significantly each year.
  - Highest peak around 2014 with about 100%, and another peak around 2018.
  - Dropped sharply in 2019.
  - Shows an upward trend in 2022.

- **Median Net Returns (Blue Line):**
  - Generally lower than average returns.
  - Most values hover between -20% to 0%.
  - Notable troughs in 2011, 2014, and 2019.
  - Starts to improve around 2022.

### 2. Distribution of Net Returns (All Sectors, H=2 Years)
- Excludes SPACs, includes IPOs greater than $50 million, holds for 2 years, and compares against S&P Small Cap Growth.
- Shows a wide range of net returns with a majority clustered around lower returns.
- Peaks are visible around 0% and 150%, indicating many IPOs yield returns in these ranges.
- Presence of negative outliers (around -150%) and extreme positive outliers (up to 750%).

### 3. Impact of Removing Top X% of IPOs on Returns
- Highlights the average net returns and average absolute returns of IPOs if the top-performing IPOs (3%, 5%, or 7%) are excluded.
  - **0% (no removal):** 
    - Average net return: +14%
    - Average absolute return: 30%
  - **3% removal:** 
    - Average net return: -4%
    - Average absolute return: 12%
  - **5% removal:** 
    - Average net return: -10%
    - Average absolute return: 6%
  - **7% removal:** 
    - Average net return: -15%
    - Average absolute return: 1%

The data suggests that IPO performance is highly volatile with substantial peaks and troughs. A small proportion of IPOs significantly drives overall performance, as removing the top performers drastically reduces the average net and absolute returns.
