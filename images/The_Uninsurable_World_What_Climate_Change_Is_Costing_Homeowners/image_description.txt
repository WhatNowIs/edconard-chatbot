The image presents a line graph illustrating the index of property catastrophe reinsurance rates, as updated and rebased to 1992 (index=100). The graph, sourced from Howden and published by the Financial Times, shows significant fluctuations in reinsurance costs over the period from 1992 to 2023.

Key points include:

1. The reinsurance rate index was just above 100 in 1992.
2. There was a substantial increase in rates around the mid-1990s, peaking around 180.
3. Rates dipped to approximately 140 around 2000, followed by another significant spike reaching around 220 by the mid-2000s.
4. From the mid-2000s to 2010, rates showed variability but generally trended downward, hitting a low point of about 120-130.
5. Since 2017, there's been a sharp increase, especially after 2020, with the index reaching its highest point at around 240 by the beginning of 2023.

This trend indicates a significant rise in the cost of reinsuring properties against extreme weather events, with rates in early 2023 more than doubling compared to the index base year of 1992.
