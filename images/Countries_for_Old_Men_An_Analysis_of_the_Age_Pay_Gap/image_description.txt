The image presents a graph labeled "Panel B: Age profiles for mean weekly wages," depicting the relationship between age and mean weekly wages for the years 1985 and 2019. Key observations from the graph can be summarized as follows:

1. **Overall Trend**: Both years show an upward trend in wages as age increases, followed by a decline as workers approach retirement age.
   
2. **1985 Data (Blue Line)**:
   - Wages start at around 350 units for younger workers (age 20).
   - Wages increase steadily with age, peaking at just under 700 units around the age of 60.
   - There is a slight decline in wages after the age of 60.

3. **2019 Data (Red Line)**:
   - Wages start higher than in 1985, at around 450 units for younger workers (age 20).
   - Wages rise more sharply compared to 1985, peaking at over 750 units around the age of 55.
   - There is a sharp decline in wages starting after age 55 to below 600 units by age 65.

**Source Information**:

  - Were at least 16 years old.
  - Had worked for at least six months in a given year.
  - Earned strictly positive wages.
  - Had full-time contracts.
  - Had not retired by December 31.
- The data is sourced from UNIENENS, Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale (Italy).

This graph effectively illustrates the wage growth trajectory over a worker's lifespan and provides insights into how wage dynamics have evolved between 1985 and 2019.
