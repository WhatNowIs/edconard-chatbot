The image presents a graph labeled "Exhibit 4: We Estimate Interest Costs as a Share of Total Spending Will Reach a New Peak by 2029." The graph measures the net interest as a share of total budget outlays over time, with the y-axis in percentage and the x-axis ranging from 1940 to 2035.

Key points from the graph:

1. Historic Data: The net interest costs have seen fluctuations over the decades with notable peaks around the mid-1940s, late 1980s, and early 1990s.

2. Recent Trends: Since the early 2000s, the net interest as a share of total budget outlays has been relatively lower but shows a rising trend post-2015.

3. Projections: Both the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Goldman Sachs (GS) project a significant rise in interest costs as a share of total spending. By 2029, these costs are estimated to reach a new peak, with CBO's May 2023 estimates represented by the light blue dashed line and GS estimates by the dark blue dashed line.

The source of the graph is given as the Congressional Budget Office and Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research.

Summary:
The graph illustrates that net interest costs as a share of total budget outlays have fluctuated historically but show a rising trend in recent years. Projections by the CBO and Goldman Sachs suggest that these costs will reach a new peak by 2029, indicating increasing pressure on budget allocations for interest payments in the future.
