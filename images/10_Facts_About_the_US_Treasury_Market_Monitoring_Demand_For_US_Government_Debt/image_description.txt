The chart titled "Term premium is key" shows the 10-year Treasury term premium from January 2006 to January 2024, measured as a percentage. The term premium is a critical element in bond markets, indicating the extra yield that investors require to commit to holding a long-term bond instead of short-term bonds.

Key observations from the data:

1. **2008 Financial Crisis:** A significant spike in the term premium reaching over 4% was observed during the financial crisis around 2008-2009.
2. **Post-Crisis Trends:** Following the crisis, the term premium generally trended downward, reaching near 0% around early 2016.
3. **Recent Years:** After a brief spike around 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the term premium has hovered around 0% to -1% from 2020 to early 2024, reflecting ongoing economic uncertainty and reactions to monetary policy.

The shaded areas on the chart highlight periods of economic downturns, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the early 2020 pandemic impact, correlating with significant movements in the term premium.
