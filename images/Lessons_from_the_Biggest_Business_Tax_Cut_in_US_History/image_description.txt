The image features a graph labeled "Figure 5: Corporate Income Tax Revenue and Investment Around the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017," which compares various types of investments and corporate income tax revenue around the period of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The investments are divided into four categories: Equipment, Structures, Intellectual Property, and All Investment. Additionally, there is a line representing corporate income tax revenue.

Key insights from the graph include:

1. **Index Values**: The data is indexed to the year 2016, with a base value of 100.
2. **Trends Over Time**:
    - Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (indicated by the vertical shaded area), there were fluctuations in all sectors monitored.
    - Post-2017, there is a noticeable divergence where intellectual property investment continues to rise significantly.
    - Equipment and All Investment also show an upward trend post-2017.
    - Structures sees minor fluctuations but generally trends upward post-2017.
    - Corporate income tax revenue (indicated by the red dotted line) shows a significant drop around the time of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 and then gradually increases post-2017, yet remains below pre-2017 levels by 2022.

3. **Data Source**: The investment data comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Fixed Asset Accounts, specifying both C- and S-corporations. Corporate income tax data comes from BEA’s National Income and Products Accounts and includes only corporate income taxes.

4. **Annotations**:
    - The data represents series in constant prices using own deflators for investment and the GDP price index for income tax revenue, indexed to equal 100 in 2016.
    - There is a specific note highlighting how BEA assigns taxes to the years when the income occurred, reassigning Section 965 “toll tax” payments to previous years.

In summary, the graph illustrates the trends in various types of corporate investments and income tax revenues around the implementation period of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The act appears to coincide with a drop in corporate income tax revenue and varying degrees of increase in different types of investments, particularly stronger growth in intellectual property investments post-2017.
