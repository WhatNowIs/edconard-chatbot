The image is a line graph titled "Baseline Estimates: $6.85-a-Day Poverty Ratio to 1990". It displays the changes in poverty ratios from 1980 to 2017. Several lines representing different data sources are plotted on the graph, showing the trend in poverty reduction over time. 

Key takeaways include:

1. Y-Axis: Represents the poverty ratio indexed to the 1990 level (set at 1).
2. X-Axis: Represents the years from 1980 to 2017.
3. Red horizontal line at the 0.5 level represents the 50% poverty reduction from the 1990 poverty rate as per MDG 1 (Millennium Development Goals).
4. Different colored lines in the graph represent various estimates and data sources:
   - **GDP (Solid blue line)**: Indicates a steep decline in poverty, reaching below the 0.5 mark by 2015.
   - **HFCE (Dashed blue line)**: Also shows a significant decline, although not as steep as the GDP line, dipping below 0.5 around 2015.
   - **WID Repl. (Green dashed line)**: Demonstrates a moderate decline, hovering around 0.5 in the later years.
   - **Surveys (Brown line)**: Shows a gradual decline, staying just above the 0.5 level.
   - **Baseline, HFCE (Pink line)**: Tracks closely with HFCE estimates.
   - **Baseline, GDP (Purple line)**: Similar in trend to the GDP line but slightly above it.

Overall, the graph reveals a general declining trend in poverty ratios from 1990 to 2017 across different datasets, with most lines dipping below the 50% reduction mark set by the MDG. This indicates a global reduction in poverty levels based on various estimations and data sources.
