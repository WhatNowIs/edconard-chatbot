The image showcases a line graph titled "Generational Wealth per Capita," adjusted for inflation with CPI-U, and provides data up to the first quarter of 2024. The data source is the Federal DFA, and the graph was created by Jeremy Horpedahl (@jmhorp).

Three generational cohorts are represented:
1. **Baby Boomers** (Yellow)
2. **Generation X** (Green)
3. **Millennials & Gen Z (18+)** (Orange)

### Key Highlights:
- **Wealth Growth Over Time**: The graph displays how per capita wealth has increased for each generation as the median cohort age progresses from 18 to 52 years.
- **Comparison at Age 31**:
  - At age 31, Millennials & Gen Z (18+) have a median wealth of $122,187.
  - At the same age, Generation X had a median wealth of $60,507.
  
### General Trends:
- **Baby Boomers** started with lower per capita wealth at younger ages but saw substantial increases as they aged, surpassing $600,000 by their 50s.
- **Generation X** follows a similar trend, reaching comparable levels to Baby Boomers as they aged.
- **Millennials & Gen Z (18+)** initially accumulate wealth at a slower rate compared to earlier generations but show significant growth starting around the age of 30.

### Analysis:
The data suggest that despite different starting points and economic conditions, each generation has seen increased wealth as they age. Millennials & Gen Z appear to be catching up quickly with the wealth accumulation trends set by previous generations, particularly after reaching their 30s. This indicates that, over time, the younger generations are closing the wealth gap seen at comparable ages in older generations.
