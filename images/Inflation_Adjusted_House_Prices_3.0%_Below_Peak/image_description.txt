The image presents a graph titled "Housing: 'Affordability Price Index' and Real Return." It plots two data series from January 1976 to 2025: the Affordability Price Index (blue line) and 5-Year Real Return (red line). Recession periods are also shaded in light blue.

Key observations:

1. **Affordability Price Index:** This index, starting at 100 in January 1976, measures the ratio of house prices to income, illustrating the affordability of housing over time.
   - From 1976 to 1980, there was a gradual increase.
   - A sharp rise in affordability around 1980, reaching a peak near 180, followed by a decline during the early 1980s.
   - A steep fall during the housing bubble of the late 2000s, bottoming around 2008-2009.
   - The index rose gradually after 2010, then saw fluctuations, with lower points around 2020.

2. **5-Year Real Return:** This shows the annualized real price increase over five years, with percentages on the right y-axis.
   - The 5-Year Real Return had periodic peaks and troughs.
   - It peaked around 1980, 1990, 2005, and 2022.
   - Major dips occurred around 1980-1982, early 1990s, 2009-2010, and mid-2020s.

3. **Recession Periods:**
   - Indicated by light blue shaded areas, occurred around 1980-1982, early 1990s, 2001, late 2007-2009, and early 2020.
   - Typically coincided with declines in both affordability and 5-Year Real Return.

**Summary:** The graph reveals trends in housing affordability and real returns over nearly five decades, with major peaks and troughs corresponding to economic cycles. Affordability generally decreased during housing bubbles and increased during economic downturns, while the 5-Year Real Return exhibited cyclic behavior, often inversely related to the affordability trend. Economic recessions played a significant role in influencing these metrics.
