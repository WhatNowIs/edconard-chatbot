The image is a line graph that depicts natural-gas prices from 2020 to 2023. The prices are shown for three regions: Asia (green line), Europe (blue line), and the U.S. (black line). The price is measured in dollars per million British thermal units ($/mmBtu).

### Key Points:
1. **Price Trends**: 
   - **Asia and Europe**: Both regions display similar price trends with fluctuations, peaking around 2022.
   - **U.S.**: Prices in the U.S. remain relatively stable and much lower compared to Asia and Europe throughout the period.

2. **Price Surge**: There is a notable spike in prices in both Asia and Europe, reaching around $70/mmBtu in Europe and slightly lower in Asia during 2022.

3. **Impact of Russian Supply Cuts**: 
   - A vertical line marks the point where "Russia starts to cut European flows".
   - This event corresponds with the sharp increase in natural gas prices in Europe and a significant rise in Asia as well.

4. **Subsequent Decline**:
   - After the peak in 2022, prices in both Asia and Europe decline but remain volatile.
   - As of 2023, the prices appear to stabilize but are still higher than pre-2021 levels.

### Summary:
The graph illustrates the volatility of natural gas prices from 2020-2023, highlighting a significant price surge in Europe and Asia around 2022, largely attributed to Russia cutting its gas supply to Europe. While the U.S. maintained relatively stable and lower prices, Europe and Asia experienced sharp rises and subsequent declines in prices, reflecting the impact of geopolitical events on energy markets.
