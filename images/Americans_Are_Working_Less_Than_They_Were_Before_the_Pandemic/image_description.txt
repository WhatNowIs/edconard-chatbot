The image presents a graph with the title "Americans Are Working Less," illustrating the average workweek hours for Americans from 2017 to 2022. The data shows a three-month moving average of hours worked and marks the recession period distinctly in grey.

Key points from the graph are:

- Before the COVID-19 pandemic (prior to 2020), the average workweek was relatively stable, fluctuating around 37 hours.
- During the pandemic (starting in early 2020), there was a sharp decline in the average workweek, dropping to about 35 hours as indicated by the significant dip in the graph during the recession period.
- Post-pandemic, there has been a gradual recovery, but the average workweek has not entirely returned to its pre-pandemic levels. As of 2022, it remains slightly lower than the 37-hour mark.

In summary, the graph suggests that the average workweek for Americans has decreased post-pandemic, showing a resilient dip during the recession, with recovery progress but still below pre-pandemic levels.
