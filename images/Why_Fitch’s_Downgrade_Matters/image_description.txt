The chart titled "American Exceptionalism" presents estimated data for 2023 on deficits (as a percentage of GDP) and debt interest (as a percentage of revenue) for various countries rated AAA, AA+, or AA- by Fitch Ratings.

Here's a summary:

### AAA-rated Countries:
1. **Germany**: Slight deficit (less than 1%), around 2% interest.
2. **Luxembourg**: Small deficit (less than 1%), minor interest payments.
3. **Netherlands**: Moderate deficit (around 2%), relatively low interest.
4. **Sweden**: Near-zero deficit, modest interest payments.
5. **Switzerland**: Small surplus (around -1%), moderate interest.
6. **Denmark**: Noticeable surplus (around -1.5%), modest interest.

### AA+-rated Countries:
1. **U.S.**: Significant deficit (about 6%), around 8% interest.
2. **Austria**: Moderate deficit (around 3%), modest interest.
3. **Finland**: Noticeable deficit (just above 2%), low interest.
4. **Canada**: Small deficit (just above 2%), low interest.

### AA-rated Countries:

2. **France**: Higher deficit (around 5%), higher interest.
3. **Belgium**: High deficit (around 4%), noticeable interest.
4. **Ireland**: Small surplus (around -1%), low interest.

### Observations:
- **Surplus Countries**: Switzerland and Denmark at AAA, and Ireland at AA- show surpluses.
- **U.S. stands out**: The U.S. has a significantly higher deficit and debt interest compared to other AA+ rated countries, reflecting a stark contrast in fiscal health.
- **Interest Payments**: The U.S. also has one of the highest percentages of debt interest payments relative to revenue among the countries listed.

### Note:
The list excludes Norway (AAA), which has a surplus of 21% of GDP.

This data underscores the fiscal challenges faced by the U.S. relative to other highly rated countries.
