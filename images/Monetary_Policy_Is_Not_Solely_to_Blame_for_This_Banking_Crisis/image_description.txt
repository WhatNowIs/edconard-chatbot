The image is a line graph showing the yield on 10-year index-linked bonds for both the UK (represented by a blue line) and the US (represented by a pink line) from 1985 to 2023. The main observation highlighted in the graph is a 30-year decline in real interest rates.

Key points to note from the graph:
1. Both UK and US real interest rates have generally decreased over the past 30 years.
2. Early on, in the mid to late 1980s, yields were relatively higher, around 3-4%.
3. Both countries exhibited several fluctuations throughout the period, with key noticeable dips and rises.
4. Around 2020, yields significantly dipped below zero, hitting about -2% in the UK.
5. By 2023, both UK and US yields climbed back, but while US real interest rates hover around 0%, UK rates remain slightly below zero.

The graph underscores a remarkable and prolonged downward trend in real interest rates, indicating changing economic conditions and monetary policies in both countries over the past three decades.
