The image provided showcases a figure titled "Impulse Responses of Investment, Sample 1950-2006." This figure contains two main columns: one illustrating the impact of a Marginal Tax Rate Cut and the other showing the effect of an ITC (Investment Tax Credit) Increase. Each column contains two graphs: one for Goods Producing and one for Private Services.

### Summary of Key Points:

**Graphs:**
1. **Marginal Tax Rate Cut:**
   - **Goods Producing:** Displays the percentage response of investment to a 1% cut in the marginal corporate income tax rate. The response initially increases, peaks around the second year, and then gradually declines.
   - **Private Services:** Shows a similar initial increase in response, peaking around the second year, followed by a decrease.

2. **ITC Increase:**
   - **Goods Producing:** Illustrates the investment response to an ITC increase with equal liability impact. The investment response rises initially, peaks, and then tapers off towards the fourth year.
   - **Private Services:** Follows a comparable pattern with an initial rise, peak, and subsequent decline.

**Note on Data and Control Variables:**
The shaded areas in each graph represent 90% confidence intervals. Various control variables have been included in the analysis, such as:
  - Lags of change in average corporate income tax rates.
  - Lags of change in average personal income tax rates.
  - Lags of changes in log real GDP, real government spending.
  - Lags of changes in marginal tax rates, investment tax credits.
  - Lags of the dependent variable, real taxable income, and log real assets.

In summary, this figure effectively demonstrates how corporate tax policy changes influence capital investment responses over time, for both goods-producing and private service sectors. The investments show an initial rise followed by a peak and later a decline, indicating a short-term boost from tax incentives.
