This image presents a detailed analysis of the trajectory of China's current account balance in relation to its GDP from 1999 to 2023. The chart displays two main lines:

1. **Official (blue line):** This line shows the official Chinese current account balance as a percentage of GDP over time. It highlights a significant surge leading up to the global financial crisis in 2008, peaking around 10% in 2007. Post-crisis, it sharply declined, stabilizing at lower percentages, and showing relatively modest fluctuations afterward.

2. **Adjusted with GACC goods trade and investment income adjustment (red line):** This line includes adjustments for goods trade and investment income according to the General Administration of Customs of China (GACC). Post-2013, it diverges increasingly from the official values, indicating a rising surplus, which becomes particularly pronounced following the pandemic around 2020, peaking significantly higher than the official figures by 2023.

**Key Insights:**
- From 1999 to the mid-2000s, there is a marked increase in the current account balance relative to GDP, reaching a zenith just before the 2008 financial crisis.
- A dramatic drop follows post-2007, where the balance plummets, stabilizes briefly around 2011, and remains low through most of the 2010s.
- Around 2015, slight surges and declines are visible, with the adjusted value suggesting a higher surplus than official records post-2013.
- Post-pandemic data, particularly the adjusted figures, show a notable rise in the surplus, indicating discrepancies between official records and trade/investment adjustments.

**Source Information:**
The data is sourced from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (China), the General Administration of Customs (China), and calculations by Matthew Klein. There is a note to check the text for details regarding the adjustments.

Overall, the image suggests that while official Chinese current account balances depict certain trends, the adjusted figures indicate potentially underreported surpluses, which have surged especially post-pandemic.
