The image illustrates a graph showing the cumulative change in the Federal funds rate and the unemployment rate during Fed hiking cycles over time. The graph spans from July 1954 to July 2022, with the following key points:

- The green line represents the cumulative change in the Fed funds rate.
- The dark blue line represents the cumulative change in the unemployment rate.
- The scale on the y-axis ranges from -4 to 14 percentage points (both left and right).
- The x-axis represents time, from July 1954 to July 2022.

Key Observations:
1. Generally, an increase in the Fed funds rate (green line spikes) corresponds with a decrease in the unemployment rate (blue line dipping).
2. Notable periods with pronounced Fed funds rate hikes include the late 1970s, early 1980s, early 1990s, around 2004-2006, and more recently around 2022.
3. The data suggests a trend where significant increases in Fed funds rates are followed by decreases in the unemployment rate, supporting the claim that "The unemployment rate goes down when the Fed raises rates."
