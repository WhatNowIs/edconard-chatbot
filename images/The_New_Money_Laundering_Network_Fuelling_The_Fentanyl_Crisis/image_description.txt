The image provides a concise overview of money laundering operations via Chinese underground banks (CUBS). Hereâ€™s a summary of the process:

1. **Chinese nationals deposit renminbi** into the Chinese underground banks.
2. **Cartel drug money in the US is deposited as dollars** into the same Chinese underground banks.
3. The underground banks then facilitate two main transactions:
   - **Cartel leaders receive funds in pesos in Mexico.**
   - **Chinese nationals in the US receive funds in dollars.**

These steps illustrate a complex money laundering scheme where the underground banks serve as intermediaries, converting illicit funds across different currencies and regions, thereby obscuring the original sources and destinations. The source of the information is the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), as referenced by FT (Financial Times).
