The chart from the Financial Times, based on FT research, illustrates the cumulative total of announced projects since August 2022, broken down by political district. The data reveals a significant disparity in investment:

1. **Republican Congressional Districts**: Secured the majority of investments, totaling approximately $140 billion.
2. **Democratic Congressional Districts**: Received considerably less investment, amounting to roughly $40 billion.
3. **Multiple/Unclear Districts**: Secured very minimal investment, barely notable on the chart.

The overarching insight is that Republican districts have attracted far more investment for announced projects compared to Democratic districts and other locations, highlighting a notable discrepancy in funding distribution.
