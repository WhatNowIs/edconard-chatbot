The image is a line graph titled "Trend in NAEP long-term trend mathematics scores at five selected percentiles for 13-year-old students." It displays the mathematics scores at five selected percentiles (90th, 75th, 50th, 25th, 10th) over various assessment years.

**Key elements and data points extracted:**

1. **Legend:**
   - Symbols denote different percentiles:
     - Circle: 10th Percentile
     - Plus: 25th Percentile
     - Diamond: 50th Percentile
     - Square: 75th Percentile
     - Pentagon: 90th Percentile
   - Line types:
     - Dashed line: Original assessment format
     - Solid line: Revised assessment format
   - Asterisk (*): Indicates a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) from 2023.

2. **Scale Score:**
   - The vertical axis ranges from 190 to 330.
   - The horizontal axis represents the assessment years from 1978 to 2023.

3. **Scores in 2023:**
   - 90th Percentile: 322
   - 75th Percentile: 301
   - 50th Percentile: 274
   - 25th Percentile: 244
   - 10th Percentile: 213

4. **Comparison Over Time:**
   - 90th Percentile shows a rise from 313 in 1978 to 329 in recent years but slightly dropped to 322 in 2023.
   - 75th Percentile increased from 291 in 1978 to 309 and then slightly decreased to 301 in 2023.
   - 50th Percentile, 25th Percentile, and 10th Percentile show a general uptrend, peaking recently before dropping slightly in 2023.

5. **Significant Changes:**
   - All percentiles except for the 10th percentile registered a significant decrease from the previous assessment year to the year 2023, as denoted by the asterisks.

6. **Interpretation Note:**
   - The NAEP LTT assessment results reflect the scores in the year the school year ends.
   - The 2023 LTT was administered in fall 2022, reported as 2023 results.

**Summary:**
The graph reveals trends in math scores for 13-year-olds at five key percentiles over time, highlighting an overall improvement in scores over several decades with a recent decline across most percentiles in 2023. The data suggests significant changes in various scores, indicating a potential area of concern for education specialists to further investigate and address.
