The image is a bar chart titled "Pricey Premiums," indicating the effects of rising insurance costs on home sales according to a survey by John Burns Research & Consulting. The chart is divided into various regions: National, Texas, Northern California, Southern California, and Florida. It uses two colors to represent the responses: blue for "No effect" and red for "Somewhat slowing sales."

Key observations:
1. **National**:
   - No effect: Dominant response, nearly 90%.
   - Somewhat slowing sales: Approx. 10%.

2. **Texas**:
   - No effect: Almost 95%.
   - Somewhat slowing sales: Just above 5%.

3. **Northern California**:
   - No effect: Around 75%.
   - Somewhat slowing sales: Around 25%.

4. **Southern California**:
   - No effect: About 80%.
   - Somewhat slowing sales: About 20%.

5. **Florida**:

Summary:
The survey indicates that rising insurance costs have varying impacts on home sales across different regions. Nationally and in Texas, the majority of respondents (around 90% and 95%, respectively) indicated that rising insurance costs have no effect on their sales. In contrast, a significant portion of respondents in Florida (approximately 40%) and Northern California (about 25%) reported that rising insurance costs are somewhat slowing sales. Southern California falls in between, with about 20% indicating a slowdown in sales. The data suggests that while most areas are largely unaffected, some regions like Florida and Northern California are experiencing notable impacts on home sales due to rising insurance costs.
