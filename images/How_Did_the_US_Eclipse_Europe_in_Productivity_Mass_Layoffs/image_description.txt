The image is a line graph comparing the real GDP per hour worked (in 2015 US dollars at purchasing power parity) of the United States (gray line), France (blue line), and Germany (black line) from 1970 to 2023. The title, "The US Is Leaving Its Main Productivity Rivals Behind," indicates that the US productivity has been outpacing that of France and Germany over the years.

Key points from the graph:

1. **Trend Overview:**
   - From 1970, all three countries show a steady increase in real GDP per hour worked.
   - Around the 2000s, the US begins to pull ahead of both France and Germany.

2. **Recent Performance:**
   - By 2023, the US shows the highest real GDP per hour worked, reaching approximately $80.
   - Germany follows with slightly lower productivity around $60-$70.
   - France's productivity sees a slight decline toward the end, dropping to around $60.

3. **Data Sources:**
   - The data is sourced from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Eurostat, and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   - Notes indicate that the 2023 numbers for France and the US are estimates derived from Eurostat and BLS data.

In summary, the graph demonstrates that the United States has significantly increased its productivity over the past few decades, outpacing both France and Germany, especially noticeable from the early 2000s onwards.
