**Summary:**

The image presents data on projected population growth by region, highlighting significant demographic shifts expected by the end of the century.

**Key Points:**

1. **Sub-Saharan Africa Growth:**
   - Sub-Saharan Africa's population is projected to experience rapid growth, likely comprising almost one-third of the world’s population by 2100.
   - This growth is driven both by high fertility rates and slowed population growth in other regions.

2. **Decline in Other Regions:**
   - Regions like Central and Southern Asia, Eastern and Southeastern Asia, and Europe and North America are expected to see a slower growth or even decline in their share of the world’s population.

3. **Graph Insights:**
   - **Left Graph (Share of World Population by Region):**
     - Visual depiction showing Sub-Saharan Africa's increasing share over time, with notable declines in regions like Eastern and Southeastern Asia and Europe and North America.
   - **Right Graph (Total Population by Region):**
     - Sub-Saharan Africa's population shows a steep upward trajectory.
     - Other regions either plateau or demonstrate a more gradual increase.

4. **Projections Basis:**
   - The projections are based on the medium fertility scenario provided by the United Nations.

5. **Historical Context:**
   - The data encompasses population levels from 1950 and projects forward to 2100.
   - Notable shifts begin to diverge more significantly from the year 2000 onwards.

6. **Visualization and Source:**
   - The data is visualized in a combination of area and line graphs, summarizing both the proportionate share of the world population and absolute population figures by region.
   - The information source is the United Nations.

This summary captures the essence of the demographical changes projected for the global population distribution by the year 2100, with an emphasis on the rapid growth in Sub-Saharan Africa and relative changes in other regions.
