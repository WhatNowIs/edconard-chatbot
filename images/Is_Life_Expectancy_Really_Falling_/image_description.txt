The image is a graph titled "Life Expectancy is Rising," showing the unisex average life expectancy at birth in the United States from 1940 to 2100. The data is sourced from the Social Security Trustees and represented in years of age. 

The graph has two lines: 

1. **Cohort Life Expectancy (Blue Line)**:
   - This line represents the actual and projected life expectancy for cohorts or groups of individuals born in specific years.
   - It starts at around 65 years in 1940 and shows a steady upward trend.
   - By 2020, it reaches approximately 80 years and is projected to continue rising, approaching 90 years by 2100.

2. **Period Life Expectancy (Orange Line)**:
   - This line indicates the period life expectancy, calculated for individuals based on mortality rates at a given time.
   - It starts below the cohort life expectancy but also shows an upward trend.
   - Around 2020, there is a noticeable dip labeled "Somewhat Misleading," indicating a potential short-term anomaly or misleading data point.
   - Despite this dip, the trend continues to rise following the dip, reaching approximately 75 years by 2020 and projected to increase to nearly 85 years by 2100.

Historic data is shown on the left side of the vertical dashed line marking the year 2020; projected data is shown on the right side of the line.

Key takeaway: Both cohort and period life expectancy in the United States are on the rise, with cohort life expectancy consistently higher than period life expectancy. Despite a dip around 2020, the overall trend indicates increasing longevity.
