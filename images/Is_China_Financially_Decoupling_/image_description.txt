The chart displays China's annual balance of payments from 2010 to 2023 in billions of dollars ($bn). The components analyzed include Net Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Net Capital Flows, Errors and Omissions (E&O), the Current Account, and Reserves.

Key points:

1. **Net Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)** (shown in pink):
   - Generally positive throughout the years.
   - Highest around 2010-2011 and 2017-2018.
   
2. **Net Capital Flows** (shown in red):
   - Highly volatile, with significant outflows especially during 2014-2016.
   - Relatively stabilized post-2016 but still fluctuating.

3. **Errors and Omissions (E&O)** (shown in yellow):
   - Variable contributions but generally positive around 2010-2011 and 2016-2017.
   - Periods of negative values particularly in 2018-2020.

4. **Current Account** (shown in blue):
   - Mostly positive across the years.
   - Noticeable surges around 2010-2011 and 2022.

5. **Reserves** (represented by the black line):
   - Exhibits significant fluctuations.
   - Sharp decline around 2015-2016 followed by recovery until 2017-2018.
   - Subsequent variations with a general upward trend post-2018, peaking in early 2020, then declining slightly towards 2023.

In summary, the chart illustrates the dynamic nature of China's balance of payments over the period. There are marked fluctuations in net capital flows and reserves, a generally positive current account, and consistent yet varying contributions from net FDI and E&O. The overall trend shows volatility with periods of significant economic activity, particularly in terms of capital flows and reserves.
