The provided image is a line graph showing the share of the prime-age population (ages 25 to 54) working or looking for work from 1970 to 2023. The data is seasonally adjusted and sourced from the Labor Department. Three lines represent different groups: men, women, and the overall population.

- **Men (blue line)**: The labor force participation rate for men has generally declined over the period. It started around 96% in 1970 and has gradually decreased to about 88% in 2023.
  
- **Women (light blue line)**: The participation rate for women rose significantly from about 50% in 1970, peaking around 77% in the late 1990s. After a slight decline and fluctuation in the 2000s, it has risen again, reaching around 78% in 2023.
  
- **Overall (gray line)**: Combining both groups, the overall labor force participation increased from about 75% in 1970 to around 83% in 2000. It then experienced some decline and fluctuations, with an uptick in recent years, leading to a percentage close to 84% in 2023.

Key observations include:
- A significant increase in women's labor force participation from 1970 to 2000.
- A general decline in men's labor force participation over the same period.
- Overall participation has stabilized after some fluctuations, showing recent growth.

The graph shows distinct impacts of economic events, with notable dips around economic crises and recoveries.
