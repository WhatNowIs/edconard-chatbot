This image presents a graph with the title "Easing Up? Financial Conditions are Tight, But Have Been Easing Up a Bit in Recent Months." The graph compares two indices over time:

1. **Chicago Fed National Financial Conditions Index (represented by a teal line)**
2. **Chicago Fed National Financial Conditions Index: Credit Subindex (represented by a yellow line)**

### Key Insights:

- **Time Frame**: The data spans from 2019 to 2023.
- **Indices**: 
    - Values above 0 indicate tighter financial conditions than average.
    - Values below 0 indicate looser financial conditions than average.

### Analysis:

- **2019 to Early 2020**:
  - Both indices remained fairly stable and close to or slightly below zero, indicating average or slightly loose financial conditions.
- **Early 2020 (Pandemic Onset)**:
  - Both indices spiked sharply. The teal line (Overall Index) increased substantially more than the yellow line (Credit Subindex).
  - This spike represents a significant tightening of financial conditions during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- **2020 to 2021**:
  - Both indices began to decrease, with the peaks falling quickly, suggesting easing financial conditions post the initial crisis.
- **2022 to 2023**:
  - The overall index (teal line) shows some fluctuations but generally trends downward, indicating an easing of financial conditions.
  - The credit subindex (yellow line) similarly trends downward but eventually dips more steeply, implying that credit conditions have notably loosened in recent months.

The graph was created by @JosephPolitano using Federal Reserve data. It illustrates that while financial conditions remain tighter than pre-pandemic levels, there has been a notable easing trend in recent months, particularly in credit conditions.
