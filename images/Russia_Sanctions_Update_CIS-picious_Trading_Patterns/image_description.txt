The image provides a bar graph illustrating the monthly exports to Russia, measured in USD billions, from January 2019 to October 2022. The different bars represent the exports from various regions and countries including:

- **EU27 (dark blue)**
- **China (blue)**
- **Turkey (light blue)**
- **Korea, Japan, and Taiwan (dark pink)**
- **U.S., U.K., and Switzerland (red)**
- **Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand (light pink)**

Key points from the graph and accompanying information include:

1. **Increased Exports in November**: The U.S. dollar value of manufactured goods exported to Russia increased by 12% in November compared to the August-October period, largely attributed to higher exports from EU27 countries.

2. **Pre-Invasion Comparison**: Despite the fluctuations, total exports in November were only 15% below the monthly average seen before the invasion.

3. **Consistent Export Trends**: 
   - From early 2019 to early 2020, the exports showed a relatively stable trend with minor fluctuations.
   - Post-March 2022, a significant drop is observed likely due to geopolitical tensions and sanctions resulting from the invasion.

4. **Gradual Rebound**: Following the sharp decline, there is evidence of a gradual recovery in export values, with fluctuating increases during mid to late-2022.

Sources for the data include various national and international statistics and customs agencies, such as Eurostat, General Administration of Customs (China), and the U.S. Census Bureau among others. The analysis and calculations were carried out by Matthew Klein.
