The provided image is a chart titled "Cyclical and Structural," comparing the spot and forward real yields on U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) over different time horizons. The chart presents two data series:
 
1. **Next 5 years (blue line)**
2. **25-year yield, 5 years ahead (red line)**

Key observations:
- **Trend Analysis (2010-2022)**:
  - The blue line (next 5 years) consistently remains lower than the red line (25-year yield, 5 years ahead) throughout the observed period.
  - Both series exhibit significant fluctuations over the years, with the blue line showing a more pronounced decline around 2011-2013 and again in 2020.
  - A notable divergence occurs between 2020 and 2022, where the blue line spikes sharply upwards, reflecting a shorter-term real interest rate increase.
  - The red line (25-year yield) shows a minor increase in recent years but remains relatively stable compared to the blue line.

- **Current State (2022)**:
  - As of the latest data point in 2022, the shorter-term real interest rates (blue line) have spiked sharply, correlating with the Federal Reserve's inflation-fighting measures since last November.
  - Meanwhile, the longer-term interest rates (red line) have increased modestly and are now about the same level as they were in mid-2014, indicating that long-term economic conditions have changed less dramatically.

In summary, the chart illustrates that shorter-term real interest rates have experienced a sharp increase recently, influenced by the Federal Reserve's actions to combat inflation. In contrast, longer-term interest rates have shown minimal changes, reflecting more stable long-term economic conditions.
