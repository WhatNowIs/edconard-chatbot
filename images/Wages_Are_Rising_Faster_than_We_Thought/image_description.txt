The image portrays a line graph illustrating the monthly annualized wage growth for nonsupervisory workers in the private sector from 1972 to 2023. The data is divided into two categories: "Leisure, hospitality, and retail" (blue line) and "All other" (red line), with the average wage growth from 1984 to 2019 depicted by a dotted line.

Key observations:

1. Historical Wage Growth (1984-2019): Hourly pay grew at approximately 3% per year.
2. Recent Trends: During the reopening period post-pandemic, the lowest-paying jobs (particularly in leisure, hospitality, and retail) experienced outsized wage gains.
3. Current Wage Growth: Overall, yearly wage growth is running about 2-3 percentage points faster than the historical average.
4. Exclusions: The pandemic months have been excluded from the data for readability.
