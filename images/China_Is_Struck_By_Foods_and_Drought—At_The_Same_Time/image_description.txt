The provided map illustrates water stress levels across China from 1979 to 2019, as compiled by the World Resources Institute (Aqueduct 4.0). The map categorizes regions into five levels of water stress: Low, Low-medium, Medium-high, High, and Extremely high. Additionally, it displays areas with arid/low water use and those lacking data.

Key highlights:
- Regions in deep red signify "Extremely high" water stress, prominently scattered across northern, northeastern, and some parts of western China.
- Zones marked in lighter shades of red and peach (High to Low water stress) indicate varying levels of water stress across central and southern China, including the Yangzi river basin.
- Areas shaded in grey highlight regions with arid conditions or low water utilization, prevalent in the northwestern part of the country.
- Regions with no data are filled in light grey, mostly noticeable in parts of western China.
- Notable locations such as the Tarim river area and Queshan county are marked, showing significant stress variability across specific areas.

The map underscores substantial water stress in several regions of China, indicating potential challenges for water resource management and sustainability in those areas.
