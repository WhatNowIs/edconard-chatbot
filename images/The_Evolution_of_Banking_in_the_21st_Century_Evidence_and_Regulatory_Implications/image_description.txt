The image contains a graph titled "Figure 1: The Growth of Bank of Deposits," specifically focusing on two key metrics from 1995 to 2023:

1. **Total Deposits as a % of GDP (Gross Domestic Product)**:
   - Represented by a solid blue line.
   - This axis shows the share of U.S. GDP consisting of total deposits at U.S. depository institutions, including chartered depository institutions, foreign banking offices, affiliated area banks, and credit unions.
   - It illustrates a general upward trend from around 55% in 1995 to about 88% in 2023, with notable increases after 2008 and significant spikes around 2020-2021.

2. **Uninsured Deposits as a % of Domestic Deposits**:
   - Represented by a dashed red line.
   - This axis shows the estimated fraction of domestic deposits that are uninsured at FDIC-covered institutions.
   - The chart demonstrates fluctuations over the period, approximately starting at 0.18 in 1995, peaking above 0.40 around 2020, and declining to around 0.32 by 2023.

**Key Periods and Trends**:
- **Late 1990s to Early 2000s**: Gradual increase in both total deposits as a percentage of GDP and uninsured deposits as a percentage of domestic deposits.
- **2008 Financial Crisis**: A noticeable impact with temporary dips, especially in uninsured deposits due to the Transaction Account Guarantee program, which temporarily expanded deposit insurance coverage.
- **Post-2008**: Significant upward trend in total deposits as a percentage of GDP, accelerating post-2010.
- **COVID-19 Pandemic (Around 2020-2021)**: Major spikes in both metrics, particularly total deposits peaking sharply.
- **Post-2021**: A slight decrease in uninsured deposits as a percentage of domestic deposits.

**Notes Section**:
- **Definitions and Sources**:
  - The data spans depository liabilities of various U.S. financial institutions.
  - The uninsured deposit share is derived from FDICâ€™s Quarterly Banking Profile.
  - GDP and deposit values sourced from FRED and Financial Accounts of the U.S.

The graph effectively visualizes how bank deposits have grown relative to GDP over nearly three decades, highlighting periods of economic crisis and regulatory changes impacting deposit insurance coverage.
