The image is a line graph titled "Household income as a proportion of GDP, 2003-2023," sourced from the OECD. It compares the household income as a percentage of GDP for several regions and countries, over a 20-year period from 2003 to 2023. The graph includes data for the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, European Union, Japan, China, and Korea.

Key observations:
- The United States consistently has the highest household income as a proportion of GDP, ranging between 80% to 85% over the years.
- The United Kingdom's percentage has remained relatively stable, fluctuating around 75% to 80%.
- Mexico’s proportion has varied but generally stayed between 70% and 75%.
- The European Union’s proportion has been stable, hovering around 70%.
- Japan's proportion has decreased over time to just below 70%.
- China started with a proportion around 60% and experienced a slight increase, stabilizing around 62%-63%.
- Korea has consistently had the lowest proportion, starting at about 57% and gradually rising to around 63% by 2023.

Overall, while there are some fluctuations within each region, the general trend shows stability or slight increases over the two decades for most economies.
