The provided image is a bar chart illustrating the quarterly foreign direct investment (FDI) liabilities into China, measured in billions of dollars ($bn), from Q1 2000 to Q1 2023. The chart notably highlights that foreign direct investment into China has reached a two-decade low.

### Key Points:
1. **Peak Investment Periods**:
   - FDI exhibited significant growth between Q1 2005 and Q1 2015.
   - There were particularly high spikes around Q1 2010 and Q1 2015, surpassing $80 billion.

2. **Recent Trends**:
   - Following peaks around Q1 2020, the FDI has been declining sharply.
   - The latest data point shown in Q1 2023 reflects a substantial decrease, with significantly lower investment levels compared to the previous two decades.

3. **Historical Comparisons**:
   - Early periods (around Q1 2000) had considerably lower FDI, which grew substantially over the 2005-2015 decade.
   - The current level aligns more closely with the early 2000s, indicating a major pullback in foreign investments after a period of notable growth.

### Implications:
- The notable drop suggests changing dynamics in global investment trends, potentially influenced by geopolitical, economic, or policy changes affecting China.
