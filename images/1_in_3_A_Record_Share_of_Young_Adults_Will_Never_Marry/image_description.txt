The chart titled "Figure 1. Historic and Forecast Ever-Married Shares by Age and Sex" illustrates the historical and projected percentages of individuals who have ever been married by different age groups and sex in the United States from 1880 to 2048. The data is depicted for ages 25, 35, and 45.

### Summary:
1. **Historical Trends (1880-2022):**
   - **Males (Actual Data):**
     - Age 25: The percentage of ever-married males at age 25 starts below 50% in 1880, sees a peak near 80% around 1960, and then declines sharply below 30% by 2022.
     - Age 35: The percentage increases from around 80% in 1880, sees fluctuations around 90% from 1940 to 1980, and then starts to decline significantly, reaching around 60% by 2022.
     - Age 45: Similarly, increases from around 90% in 1880, maintains around 95% until 1980, and declines to about 70% by 2022.
   - **Females (Actual Data):**
     - Age 25: Follows a similar pattern as males at age 25 but starts higher and peaks close to 90%.
     - Age 35: Remains relatively stable around 90%-95% until around 1980, after which it declines more slowly than the males.
     - Age 45: Shows minimal variation, maintaining between 90-95% until starting to decline slightly more recently, falling to around 80% by 2022.

2. **Forecast Trends (2022-2048):**
   - **Males (Forecast Data):**
     - Age 25: The percentage is projected to remain low, below 30%.
     - Age 35: Expected to continue declining to around 50%.
     - Age 45: Projected to decline further to around 60%.
   - **Females (Forecast Data):**
     - Age 25: The percentage is projected to stabilize slightly above 30%.
     - Age 35: Expected to stabilize around 60%.
     - Age 45: Expected to decline slightly to around 70%.

### Observations:
- The share of ever-married individuals by age has been declining over time for both males and females.
- Historical data shows higher marriage rates for females compared to males across all age groups.
- The forecast indicates a continued decline in the percentage of ever-married individuals, with younger individuals (age 25) showing the most significant decrease.

### Sources:
The data sources include U.S. Census data from 1880-2000, American Community Survey data from 2008-2022, and estimates using Current Population Survey annual changes for the intermediary periods.

This trend highlights significant societal changes in marriage patterns over the past century and forecasts a continued shift away from traditional marriage practices.
