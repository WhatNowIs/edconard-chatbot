The image is a chart depicting the changes in Russian industrial production and pollution levels in industrial regions from June 2019 to early 2023. The black line represents the change in official Russian industrial production, while the red line indicates pollution levels in industrial regions.

Key points summarized:
1. **Industrial Production Trends**:
   - Initially, industrial production fluctuated around the 0% change mark throughout 2019.
   - There was a significant decline around 2020, indicating a reduction by up to nearly 10%.
   - After this decrease, production began to recover around mid-2020, eventually reaching peaks near 10%.
   - Post-2021, industrial production saw smaller fluctuations around the baseline, recording a steady performance in early 2023 with a slight uptick.

2. **Pollution Trends**:
   - Pollution levels displayed a gradual change, initially decreasing alongside the industrial production decline in 2020.
   - There was a substantial rise in pollution levels during 2021, peaking at about 15%.
   - Following this peak, pollution levels fell sharply from mid-2022, hitting a low near 15% reduction.
   - Signs of a slight recovery in pollution levels are visible as of early 2023.

3. **Overall Observations**:
   - There is a correlation between industrial production and pollution levels, where increases in production often coincide with higher pollution.
   - Both variables showed significant volatility, especially during 2020-2021, likely reflecting the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic recovery phases.
