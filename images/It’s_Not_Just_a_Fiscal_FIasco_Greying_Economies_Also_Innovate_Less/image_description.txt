The image titled "Brain freeze" is a graph showcasing the percentage of total patents filed in Japan from 1990 to 2019 across various technological fields. The graph includes data from Chinese, European, Japanese, and US patent offices. 

Key observations from the graph:

1. **Hydrogen Storage**: The percentage of patents filed in Japan for hydrogen storage technology showed an overall decline from 75% in 1990 to less than 25% by 2019.

2. **Computer Vision**: Patents in this area remained relatively steady through the years until around 2010, after which there was a noticeable decrease.

3. **Self-Driving Vehicles**: These patents saw a rise during the late 1990s and early 2000s but have since declined.

4. **Blockchain**: Patents related to blockchain technology had a significant increase in the early 2000s but have also seen a downward trend.

5. **Genome Editing**: This category has consistently remained low in terms of patents filed when compared to the other technologies.

The source is cited as a paper titled "The rise of Chinaâ€™s technological power: the perspective from frontier technologies" by A. Bergeaud and C. Verluise, published in a CEP discussion paper in 2022. 

The overall trend indicates a general decrease in the percentage of patents filed by Japan in these frontier technology areas over the selected time period.
