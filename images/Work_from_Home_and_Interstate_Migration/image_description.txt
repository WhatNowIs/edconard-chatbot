The figure shows the share of adults aged 18-64 who moved out of their state since February 2020, segmented by their work-from-home (WFH) status before and after the pandemic. The survey data is from the Real-Time Population Survey (RPS). 

Three groups are analyzed:
1. "Commute-Commute": Commuters pre- and post-pandemic.
2. "WFH-WFH": Individuals who worked from home both pre- and post-pandemic.
3. "Commute-WFH": Pre-pandemic commuters who switched to WFH during the pandemic.

The chart includes two types of bars:
- Dark bars reflect unconditional means.
- Light bars represent coefficients from a linear probability model with demographic controls, using sample weights.

The whiskers on the bars represent 95% confidence intervals based on heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors.

The summary shows that the share of people moving out of state increased more among those who switched to or continued WFH than among those who continued commuting. This suggests WFH flexibility may facilitate higher interstate migration.
