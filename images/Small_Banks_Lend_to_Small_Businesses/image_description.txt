The provided graph, titled "Banking crisis having negative impact on small and medium-sized companies," compares the performance of three indices: S&P 100 Index, Russell Microcap Index, and S&P Midcap 400 Index. The timeframe of the graph spans from March 1, 2023, to April 26, 2023, with all indices indexed at 100 on March 1, 2023.

Key observations:

1. **Impact of SVB Collapse**:
   - The SVB collapse, marked on the graph around March 8, 2023, corresponds with a noticeable decline in the Russell Microcap Index and the S&P Midcap 400 Index, indicating the banking crisis's negative impact on smaller and medium-sized companies.
   
2. **Performance Variations**:
   - **S&P 100 Index**: This index, representing larger companies, exhibited more robust performance and relative stability during the observed period, with values predominantly above 100.
   - **Russell Microcap Index**: This index experienced significant volatility. After the SVB collapse, it dropped sharply and remained below the initial index value of 100, indicating marked negative impact on microcap companies.
   - **S&P Midcap 400 Index**: This index also showed decline around the time of the SVB collapse and exhibited fluctuations, with values generally tracking between 85 and 95, indicating a significant but less severe impact compared to microcap firms.

3. **Long-term Impact**:
   - By the end of April 2023, neither the Russell Microcap Index nor the S&P Midcap 400 Index had fully recovered to their initial indexed value of 100, suggesting a sustained adverse effect from the banking crisis.

In summary, the graph shows that the banking crisis, epitomized by the SVB collapse, adversely affected small and medium-sized companies significantly, as evidenced by the underperformance of the Russell Microcap Index and the S&P Midcap 400 Index. Larger companies, represented by the S&P 100 Index, displayed resilience with slight fluctuations but overall better performance.
