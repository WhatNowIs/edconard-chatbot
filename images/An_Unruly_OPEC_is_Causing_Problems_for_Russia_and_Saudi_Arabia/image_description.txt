The image is a line graph from The Economist, titled "The America of oil," which shows crude oil production as a percentage of the world total for three countries: the United States, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. 

Here's a summary of the key points:

- The data spans from 2017 to a projected forecast for Q4 of 2023.
- The United States has shown a significant increase in its crude oil production starting from 2017, leading to a peak around 2023 where production reaches approximately 16% of the world's total.
- Russia's production has been relatively stable with minor fluctuations, standing slightly above 12% by 2023 but showing a slight downward trend.
- Saudi Arabia's crude oil production remained stable until it showed a sharp decline around 2022, leveling off at about 11% by 2023.
- By the projected Q4 of 2023, the United States is leading in crude oil production with the highest percentage, followed by Russia and then Saudi Arabia.

Overall, the United States has become a dominant player in crude oil production globally as evidenced by their increasing share depicted in the graph.
