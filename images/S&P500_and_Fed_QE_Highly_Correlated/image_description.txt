The image is a graph showing the performance of the S&P 500 index (green line) alongside the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing (QE) net assets (grey line) from March 2020 to May 2023. The left y-axis represents the Federal Reserve's QE measure in billion dollars, while the right y-axis represents the S&P 500 index value.

**Summary:**
The graph details the relationship between the Federal Reserve's QE and the S&P 500 index since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. It demonstrates a sharp increase in Fed QE beginning in March 2020, coinciding with significant growth in the S&P 500 index. Throughout 2021, though the S&P 500 underwent some fluctuations, both metrics peaked. Post-2021, the S&P 500 shows notable volatility while the Fed's QE flattened out and started a modest decline. As of May 2023, the S&P 500 rebounded somewhat, aligning with a slight recovery in QE assets.
