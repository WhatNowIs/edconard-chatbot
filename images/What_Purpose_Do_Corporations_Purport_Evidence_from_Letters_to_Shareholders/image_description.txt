The image is a line graph titled "Panel E: Social Objectives," displaying the trends over time (from 1960 to 2020) of various social objectives. The x-axis is labeled "Fiscal Year," while the y-axis ranges from 0 to 0.8, though its specific label is unclear, it reflects some measure related to the social objectives.

There are four lines on the graph, each representing different social objectives:

1. **Ethics (green line)**:
   - Shows a relatively modest and stable trend until around the mid-1980s.
   - Starts to gradually increase from the late 1980s, with a significant rise after 2010.

2. **ESG Environment (brown line)**:
   - Displays a steady increase starting from the early 1980s.
   - Experiences multiple peaks and valleys, with a notably sharp rise beginning around 2000.

3. **ESG Social (black line)**:
   - Exhibits a relatively stable trend until the mid-1990s, after which it starts to increase.
   - Shows significant volatility with spikes and dips, especially post-2000, but with an overall upward trend.

4. **Philanthropy (yellow line)**:
   - Maintains a low trend with minimal variations until around the mid-1990s.
   - Starts to rise gradually from the late 1990s and experiences a sharper increase post-2000.

Overall, all social objectives display a rising trend from the late 1990s onward, with significant increases noted in "Ethics" and "ESG Environment" compared to "Philanthropy" and "ESG Social." This suggests a growing importance and focus on these social objectives over the 60-year span depicted.
