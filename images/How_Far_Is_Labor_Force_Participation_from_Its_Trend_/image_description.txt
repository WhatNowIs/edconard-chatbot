The image displays a line chart titled "Estimated trend in aggregate labor force participation." The vertical axis represents the labor force participation percentage, ranging from 60% to 68%, and the horizontal axis marks the years from 1976 to 2031.

Key points from the chart:
1. **Historical Data (1976-2022)**
   - Labor force participation increased steadily from 1976, starting at approximately 62%, reaching a peak of around 67% in the late 1990s.
   - From the early 2000s, the labor force participation began to decline gradually, dropping to around 63%-64% by 2022.
   - The actual labor force participation (green line labeled "Actual LFP") closely follows the estimated trend (blue line labeled "Trend") throughout this period.

2. **Projection (2023-2031)**
   - The trend continues to project a downward trajectory in labor force participation, falling below 63% by 2023 and decreasing even further as it approaches 2031.
   - The projected trend (dashed blue line) suggests a continuing decline, reaching possibly around 60% by 2031.

**Source Information**
- The data is sourced from the Current Population Survey (microdata from 1976-2022) along with authorsâ€™ calculations.

Summary:
The chart illustrates the historical trend and future projections of aggregate labor force participation from 1976 to 2031. Labor force participation saw substantial growth until the late 1990s, peaked around 67%, and then steadily declined to just above 63% by 2022. The projection indicates that this downward trend is expected to continue, potentially falling to around 60% by 2031.
