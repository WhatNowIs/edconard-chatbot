The image is a graph showing the annualized percentage change in nominal hourly earnings over a 30-month period from January, February, and March 2020 to July, August, and September 2022. 

Key points from the graph:
- The x-axis represents the hourly earnings percentile, ranging from 0 to 100.
- The y-axis represents the annualized percentage change in nominal hourly earnings, ranging from 0.00 to 0.24.
- The graph includes two key lines:
  1. **Wage Growth (red dashed line)**: This line shows the wage growth across different percentiles of hourly earnings, with higher growth percentages at the lower earnings percentiles and gradually decreasing as the earnings percentile increases.
  2. **CPI Inflation (blue dashed line)**: This horizontal line is set at approximately 0.14, representing the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate.

Summary:
Over the 30-month period from early 2020 to late 2022, wage growth has varied significantly across different hourly earnings percentiles. Lower-wage workers (lower percentiles) have experienced higher nominal wage growth compared to higher-wage workers (higher percentiles). The CPI inflation rate is indicated as a reference line to show that wage growth for lower-wage earners has outpaced inflation, suggesting that low-wage workers might be coming out ahead in terms of real earnings during this period. The graph illustrates how earnings increase relatively more for those in the lower earnings percentiles than those in the higher earnings percentiles. The data suggests that lower-wage workers have seen a stronger wage growth compared to inflation, more so than higher-wage workers.
