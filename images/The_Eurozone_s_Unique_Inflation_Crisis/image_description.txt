This graph displays Eurozone nominal wage growth over time, specifically from before 2000 to 2023. Here are the key points:

1. **Two Series**: The graph features two data series:
   - **EA-19 Labor Cost Index, Compensation, All Industries (Yellow Line)**: This typically measures the overall cost of labor in the economy.
   - **EA-19 Negotiated Wage Growth (Teal Line)**: This measures the growth in wages that have been formally negotiated, perhaps through collective bargaining agreements.
 
2. **Time Range**: The x-axis represents the time period from before 2000 to 2023.

3. **Growth Trends**:
   - **Pre-2005**: Both indices fluctuate between 2% and 3% annual growth.
   - **2005-2010**: There's an increase in labor cost index and negotiated wage growth, sometimes reaching above 3%, but with noticeable dips and peaks.
   - **2010-2015**: Growth experiences volatility, with significant drops around 2010 and spikes thereafter.
   - **Post-2015**: Both indices again display volatility, with the labor cost index experiencing sharper changes, including a significant dip around the COVID-19 pandemic (2020).
   - **Post-2020 to 2023**: Both indices rise sharply, with the labor cost index peaking above 4% before falling back slightly, while negotiated wage growth remains stable yet elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels.

4. **Current Status**:
   - The graph suggests that right now, Eurozone wage growth remains slightly above pre-pandemic levels based on the latest data points.

This summary captures the essence of Eurozone nominal wage growth trends, emphasizing periods of volatility, notable peaks and troughs, and the present status in a historical context.
