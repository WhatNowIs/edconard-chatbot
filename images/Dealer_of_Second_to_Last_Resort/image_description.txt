The image is a line graph depicting the relationship between cash balances and Treasury bills outstanding from February 2022 to October 2022. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

1. **Cash Balance and T-bills Outstanding**: 
   - The cash balance is represented by the dark blue line on the left-hand y-axis (in billions of dollars).
   - The T-bills outstanding is shown by the light blue line on the right-hand y-axis (also in billions of dollars).

2. **Trend Over Time**:
   - In February 2022, the cash balance was around $700 billion while T-bills outstanding was around $4,100 billion.
   - Through March and April 2022, the cash balance fluctuated between $550 billion and $700 billion. During this period, T-bills outstanding marginally declined towards $3,950 billion.
   - From April to May 2022, there was a notable increase in the cash balance, peaking at over $950 billion in May.
   - Concurrently, the T-bills outstanding dropped to approximately $3,800 billion.

3. **Highlighted Period (May-June 2022)**:
   - The graph highlights a specific period (May to June 2022) where excess cash balances (over $900 billion) could potentially be used for buybacks.
   - Following this peak, the cash balance significantly declined to around $700 billion by July 2022, then fluctuated between $550 billion and $800 billion until October 2022.
   - Meanwhile, T-bills outstanding continued to decrease to around $3,650 billion by the end of this period.

4. **Source**:
   - The data is sourced from the Treasury.

In summary, the graph illustrates the Treasury's strategy of using bill issuance to manage elevated cash balances, with a notable peak and subsequent decline in cash balances during the mid-year of 2022, possibly indicating a period of significant buybacks.
