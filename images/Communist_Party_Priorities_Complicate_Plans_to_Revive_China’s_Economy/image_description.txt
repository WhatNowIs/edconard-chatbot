The provided image features a graph titled "Cautious Spenders," which highlights that consumption constitutes a relatively small portion of China's economy compared to other regions. This is illustrated through a chart depicting "Household expenditure as a share of GDP" for the U.S., World, EU, and China from 1980 to 2020.

Key insights:
- **U.S.** (yellow line): Maintains a consistent household expenditure share of GDP around 60-70%.
- **World** (light grey line): Relatively stable, hovering around 55-60%.
- **EU** (dark grey line): Gradual decline from around 60% in 1980 to approximately 50% by 2020.
- **China** (red line): Significant decline from about 50% in 1980 to around 35% by 2010, with a slight recovery thereafter but remaining the lowest among the entities compared.

Summary:
The graph underscores a notable trend where household expenditure in China as a share of GDP has significantly decreased over the last four decades, unlike the more stable or less steeply declining trends observed in the U.S., World, and EU. As a result, consumption plays a smaller role in China's economy compared to these regions.
