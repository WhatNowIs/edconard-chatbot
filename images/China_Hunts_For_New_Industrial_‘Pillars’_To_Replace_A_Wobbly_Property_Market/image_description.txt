The chart illustrates the year-on-year percentage change in China's property investment from 2004 to 2024. Key observations include:

1. **Early High Growth (2004-2006)**: Property investment growth was high, reaching close to 50% in 2004, followed by a gradual decline.

2. **Volatile Period (2007-2011)**: This period reflects considerable fluctuations. A steep dip in 2008 coincides with the global financial crisis, but a sharp recovery follows immediately, peaking again around 2010.

3. **Steady Decline (2012-2016)**: From 2011 onwards, there is a consistent decline, with growth percentages tapering off steadily.

4. **Stability (2016-2019)**: Modest and relatively stable growth, fluctuating around the 5-10% mark.

5. **Pandemic Shock (2020-2022)**: Evident spike and subsequent dive around this period, possibly attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic falloutâ€”after an initial surge, rates plunged below zero.

6. **Current Trends (2023-2024)**: As of the most recent data in 2024, property investment growth is in the negative territory, indicating a contraction.

Overall, the trend shows high initial growth, followed by fluctuating increases and decreases with recent contractions in the property market investments in China.
