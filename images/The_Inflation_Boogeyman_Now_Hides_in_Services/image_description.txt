The image presents a graph from Bloomberg illustrating inflation trends among different sectors from 2017 to 2023, highlighting concerns about services inflation. The key observations include:

1. **Goods Deflation**: The title and subtitle state that goods deflation is underway, while services deflation has not yet started.
2. **Services (Excluding Food & Energy)**: Represented in blue, the inflation rate for services has remained steady, with no significant deflation observed.
3. **Goods (Excluding Food & Energy)**: Shown in black, the inflation rate for goods spiked in 2021 and 2022 but has since started to show signs of deflation.
4. **Food**: Depicted in gray, food-related inflation mirrored the trends seen in goods, increasing significantly in 2021 and 2022 with some recent moderation.
5. **Energy**: Illustrated in red, energy prices demonstrated significant volatility, especially starting from late 2020, peaking in 2022 before showing signs of deflation.

The overall inflation rate across these sectors peaked in 2022 but has varied widely by category, causing a distinct concern for sustained services inflation as opposed to goods where deflation is evident.
