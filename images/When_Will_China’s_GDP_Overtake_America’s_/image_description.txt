The image is a line graph comparing different forecasts of China's GDP as a percentage of the United States' GDP. The title, "Smaller and further away," suggests that expectations for China's economic growth relative to the United States may have been scaled down.

Here are the key takeaways:

1. **Forecasting Sources**: Different forecasts are plotted from various sources, including:
   - **Goldman Sachs (2011, 2022)**
   - **OECD (2021)**
   - **Capital Economics (2023)**

2. **Actual Data**: The thick dashed black line represents actual data up to the present time.

3. **Past Predictions**: 
   - In 2003, Goldman Sachs forecasted Chinaâ€™s GDP to surpass the U.S. by the early 2020s, as shown by the dotted grey line.
   - By 2011, updated predictions showed that China's GDP would match the U.S. by around 2026.

4. **Updated Predictions**:
   - **Goldman Sachs (2022)**: Predicts China's GDP will reach parity with the U.S. around 2035 and continue growing to about 137% by 2050.
   - **OECD (2021)**: Foresees China reaching parity in 2034 and continuing to about 125% by 2040.
   - **Capital Economics (2023)**: Suggests a delayed parity, achieved in 2050 and growing slower compared to previous forecasts.

5. **Trend**: Each subsequent forecast has pushed the predicted date for China reaching GDP parity with the U.S. further into the future, with growth projections declining over time.

6. **Historical Comparisons**: The initial trend showed rapid growth, but newer predictions highlight a more tempered pace of economic convergence between China and the U.S.

This graph illustrates the shifting expectations and increasing caution among economic forecasters regarding China's future GDP growth relative to the United States.
