This graph presents the on-balance sheet dollar funding of non-US banks, illustrating the amounts outstanding in trillions of US dollars from 2000 to 2020. The data is broken down into several categories of funding sources:

1. **Non-bank deposits:**
   - In the US.
   - Outside the US.

2. **International debt securities.**

3. **Liabilities:**
   - To US banks.
   - To central banks.

Key observations from the graph include:

- **Overall Growth:** There is a general upward trend in the total dollar funding for non-US banks over the 20-year period.
- **Major Contributions:** Most of the increase in funding can be attributed to an uptick in both non-bank deposits (in and outside the US) and international debt securities.
- **Notable Increases:** Post-2008 financial crisis and in the years leading up to 2020, there was a significant increase in dollar funding, indicating increased reliance on various sources of dollar funding.
- **Liabilities:** Both liabilities to US banks and to central banks have shown growth, contributing to changes in the funding landscape.
