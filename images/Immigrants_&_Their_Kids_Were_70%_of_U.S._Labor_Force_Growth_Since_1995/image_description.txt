The image, titled "Figure 2: Immigrants and their children are growing in importance in the labor force," presents data on the share of the civilian labor force by worker background from the years 1995 to 2022. Two lines are represented:

1. **Immigrants (purple line)**: This line shows the increasing trend of immigrants' share in the labor force over the indicated period.
2. **Immigrants & Children of Immigrants (light blue line)**: This line indicates the share of the labor force consisting of immigrants and their children, also showing a growing trend.

Key observations:

- In 1995, the share of the labor force made up of immigrants was just under 10%.
- This share steadily increased, reaching approximately 15% around 2020.
- The combined share of immigrants and their children in the labor force started at around 15% in 1995.
- This combined share has grown significantly and reached almost 25% by 2022.

The data source for this information is the Current Population Survey, Annual Social and Economic Supplement/March Supplement from 1995â€“2022. An important note mentions that the population of non-immigrants with a foreign parent was lower from 1999 to 2001 than in 1995.

This trend highlights the growing significance of immigrants and their descendants in the U.S. labor force over the past few decades.
