The image is a line graph that compares the actual Federal-funds rate with various policy rule prescriptions from 2021 to 2024. The Federal-funds rate represents the interest rate at which banks lend to each other overnight.

Key components:
- The "Actual" Federal-funds rate is shown with a black line.
- Other lines represent prescriptions based on different policy rules:
  - First-difference (brown)
  - Balanced-approach (light green)
  - Taylor (1993) (blue)
  - Adjusted Taylor (1993) (light blue)
  - Balanced-approach (shortfalls) (beige)

Summary of the data:
- The actual rate (black line) was steady at 0% and began increasing sharply in early 2022, reaching around 5% by mid-2022, then leveling off around this rate.
- The "First-difference" rule shows the most dramatic swings, with a sharp rise to almost 9% in early 2022 before aligning closer to the other prescriptions by mid-2022.
- The other policy rule prescriptions, including Balanced-approach, Taylor (1993), Adjusted Taylor (1993), and Balanced-approach (shortfalls), demonstrated similar trends with an upward trajectory starting in late 2021, peaking around 6-8% before gradually declining in 2023.

Notes and sources:
- Policy rules are derived from past research and calculated by Federal Reserve staff through 2023 and thereafter by Goldman Sachs.
- Data sources include the Federal Reserve and Goldman Sachs.

This graph visually displays how the actual Federal-funds rate aligned or diverged from theoretical policy rules over the specified timeframe.
