The graph in Figure 1 depicts the manufacturing employment share in the U.S. and U.S. excluding Sun Belt regions from 1950 to 2000. The x-axis represents the years from 1950 to 2000, while the y-axis shows the manufacturing employment share, ranging from 0.30 to 0.55.

Key observations:
1. **Overall Decline:** Both lines on the graph indicate a long-term decline in manufacturing employment share over the 50-year period.
2. **Specific Trends:**
   - The solid line represents the entire U.S. It starts just above 0.52 in 1950, shows a steady decline until the early 1970s, followed by a sharp drop until the mid-1980s, then continues to decline more gradually.
   - The dotted line represents the U.S. excluding the Sun Belt. It starts around 0.55 in 1950 and also shows a continuous decline, though not as steep as the U.S. overall, particularly after 1970.

**Summary:**
From 1950 to 2000, the manufacturing employment share in the U.S. consistently declined, with a more pronounced decrease in the overall U.S. compared to the U.S. excluding the Sun Belt. This highlights the significant structural changes in the American economy and industrial landscape over the second half of the 20th century, particularly the diminishing role of manufacturing in providing employment.
