1. **Permits:** Permits for single-family units (yellow) and multifamily units (blue) show different trends, but the specific data points are not provided.
2. **Starts:** Starts for multifamily units are 20% below the 2019 pace, indicating a slowdown in new multifamily housing projects compared to the past.
3. **Construction:** The multifamily construction rate is shown to be highly volatile.
