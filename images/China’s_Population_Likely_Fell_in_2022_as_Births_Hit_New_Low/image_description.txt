The chart titled "More Deaths, Fewer Births" details the changes in birth and death rates in China from 1978 to 2022. The graph reveals the following key points:

1. **Birth Rate Trends**:
   - The birth rate (represented by the black line) peaked around the late 1980s and early 1990s, reaching approximately 25 million births.
   - Since then, the birth rate has consistently declined, dropping significantly to nearly 10 million births by 2022.

2. **Death Rate Trends**:
   - The death rate (represented by the yellow line) has been steadily increasing from the late 1970s onwards.
   - Although the death rate has been relatively stable over the years, it showed a slight increase, approaching the birth rate by 2022.

3. **Forecasts**:
   - There are two forecasted scenarios for birth rates: high (represented by the pink line) and low (represented by the blue line).
   - By 2022, both forecast scenarios converge, indicating a severe decline in birth rates, almost equaling the death rates.

4. **Demographic Implication**:
   - The convergence of the birth rate and death rate lines suggests a shrinking population, primarily influenced by decreasing births and increasing deaths as the nation ages.

Overall, China's population is facing a critical demographic shift marked by fewer births and an increasing number of deaths, suggesting potential challenges such as population aging and resultant socioeconomic impacts.
