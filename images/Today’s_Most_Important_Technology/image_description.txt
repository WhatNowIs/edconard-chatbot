The image titled "Share of adult men overweight or obese vs. daily supply of calories, World, 1975 to 2019" presents a correlation between the daily caloric supply and the share of adult men who are overweight or obese. Being overweight or obese is quantified by a body mass index (BMI) greater than 25. 

### Key Highlights:
1. **Time Span:** The data spans from 1975 to 2019.
2. **General Trend:** Over the years, as the daily caloric supply increased globally, there was a corresponding rise in the percentage of adult men who are overweight or obese.
3. **Caloric Supply:** The caloric supply ranges from approximately 1,500 kcal to well over 3,500 kcal daily.
4. **Overweight/Obesity Share:** The share of adult men overweight or obese has moved from about 20% in 1975 to approximately 43% in 2019.
5. **Data Source:** The data is sourced from the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC) 2017 and other sources, compiled by Our World in Data.

### Detailed Observations:
- In **1975**, the global average daily caloric supply was around 2,200 kcal, and about 20% of adult men were overweight or obese.
- By **1985**, the share increased to about 27%, with the caloric supply around 2,400 kcal.
- In **1996**, the share climbed to approximately 35%, with caloric supply nearing 2,700 kcal.
- By **2008** and **2010**, the overweight/obese share was about 40% and above, with daily caloric supply ranging between 2,800 kcal and 3,000 kcal.
- From **2010 onwards**, the share has steadily increased, touching around 43% in 2019.

### Regional Data:
- The image includes a color legend for different regions (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South America). However, specific regional trends are not visually detailed in the summary points.

### Conclusion:
There is a clear global trend showing that as the daily caloric supply has progressively increased over the past several decades, so has the percentage of adult men being overweight or obese. The correlation suggests a strong influence of increased caloric intake on the rise in the prevalence of overweight and obesity among adult men worldwide.
