The image presents two graphs titled "Figure 2: Tax & transfer rates, PSZ v. AS," comparing the trends of tax and transfer rates according to two different sets of researchers: Piketty, Saez, Zucman (PSZ) on the left, and Auten and Splinter (AS) on the right. The data spans from 1960 to 2020 and is categorized into four income groups: Bottom 50%, Middle 40%, Top 10%, and Top 1%.

### Observations from the Graphs:

#### Piketty, Saez, and Zucman (PSZ):
1. **Top 1% (Green Line)**:
   - Consistently around 40-45% over the years with slight fluctuations.
   
2. **Top 10% (Black Line)**:
   - Remains around 30-35% with minimal changes over time.
   
3. **Middle 40% (Red Line)**:
   - Stays around 25% consistently through the time span.
   
4. **Bottom 50% (Blue Line)**:
   - Shows a decrease from about 15% in 1960 to -12% in 2020, indicating a significant drop in tax and transfer rates for this group with some fluctuations around the 2000s.

#### Auten and Splinter (AS):
1. **Top 1% (Green Line)**:
   - Shows stability around 34-37% over the years.
   
2. **Top 10% (Black Line)**:
   - Maintains around 25-30%, showing more stability over time.
   
3. **Middle 40% (Red Line)**:
   - Relatively stable around 20-25% throughout the years.
   
4. **Bottom 50% (Blue Line)**:
   - Starts around 0% in 1960 but drastically drops to -50% by 2020, suggesting a significant decrease similar to the PSZ data but more pronounced.

### Summary:
Both sets of researchers indicate significant differences in tax and transfer rates across different income groups from 1960 to 2020. The Bottom 50% experiences a notable and dramatic decline in tax and transfer rates over time, with the PSZ data showing a reduction to -12% and AS data showing a decrease to -50%. The Top 1% and Top 10% remain relatively stable across both datasets, indicating that higher income groups experience much less variation in their tax and transfer rates. The Middle 40% also shows stability across the years in both datasets. This highlights a growing disparity in tax and transfer rates, particularly impacting the Bottom 50% of the population.
