The image is a line graph titled "Degree Decline," which depicts the percentage of U.S. job postings that require at least a four-year college degree over a period from 2018 to 2023. The graph shows a decline from around 47.5% in 2018 to approximately 39-40% in 2023. There is a significant drop around mid-2020, with the percentage falling below 35%, but it then shows some recovery. The data source is Burning Glass Instituteâ€™s analysis of Lightcast data, and the note clarifies that the statistics only include job postings with educational requirements. 

In summary, the graph illustrates a noticeable trend of declining educational requirements for U.S. job postings over the past five years, with a marked dip during mid-2020, which could suggest changing employer requirements or broader shifts in the job market.
