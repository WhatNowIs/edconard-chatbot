The heat map provides a detailed comparison of various categories relevant to urban recovery and economic conditions across major U.S. cities. The categories assessed include urban recovery, economy/demographics since 2019, business conditions, and fiscal health. Each category is evaluated and color-coded for easier interpretation—green indicating better performance and red indicating poorer performance.
