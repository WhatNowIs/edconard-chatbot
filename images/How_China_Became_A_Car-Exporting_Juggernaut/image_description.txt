The graph illustrates the trend in passenger-car exports for five countries—Japan, Germany, the United States, India, and China—with a focus on a three-month moving average from 2015 to 2023.

**Key Observations:**
- **Japan and Germany**:
  - Both experienced significant fluctuations throughout the period.
  - There was a noticeable drop for both countries around the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic but a recovery trend observed thereafter.
  - Japan's exports generally hovered around 0.3-0.4 million cars, while Germany's exports were slightly lower overall.
- **United States**:
  - Remained relatively stable over the period, with modest fluctuations and flatter trends compared to Japan and Germany, keeping the export levels mostly below 0.2 million cars.
- **India**:
  - Showed minor and steady growth, staying below 0.1 million car exports through the majority of the observed timeline.
- **China**:
  - Exhibited substantial growth, starting from less than 0.05 million and experiencing sharp increases, particularly after Tesla opened its first factory in China in late 2019.
  - Post-2020, China's exports showed a rapid upward trend, surpassing 0.2 million by 2023.
  
**COVID-19 Impact**:
- The onset of the pandemic in early 2020 caused a significant dip in car exports for Japan and Germany. However, both countries showed recovery trends later.
  
In summary, Japan and Germany maintained higher levels of passenger-car exports but with more considerable volatility and a notable dip during the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States kept consistent but low export levels, while India showed minimal increases. China showed remarkable growth, especially after 2019, and continued to rise sharply post-pandemic.
