The infographic from the Financial Times presents data from the OECD's "Indicators of Immigrant Integration 2023" report, comparing socio-economic outcomes among native and immigrant populations in France, Germany, the UK, and the US. The key metrics include:

1. **Relative Poverty (%):**
   - Immigrants in France, especially recent arrivals, exhibit higher relative poverty rates than native-born individuals. 
   - Germany, the UK, and the US also show higher poverty rates for immigrants compared to natives, but the disparity is particularly pronounced in France.

2. **Percentage in Bottom Income Decile:**
   - In France, a higher proportion of both recent and settled immigrants fall into the bottom income decile compared to native-born individuals.
   - Germany and the UK show similar trends but to a lesser extent. The US data suggests a lesser disparity in this metric.

3. **Unemployment (%):**
   - Unemployment rates for immigrants (both recent and settled) in France are significantly higher than for native-born individuals.
   - Germany and the UK show a comparable trend, though the differences are smaller. In the US, unemployment disparities between natives and immigrants appear relatively small.

4. **Youth Unemployment (%):**
   - French youth unemployment is notably high among recent immigrant youth compared to native-born youth.
   - Germany and the UK also exhibit high youth unemployment among immigrants, with the US showing relatively more balanced rates.

5. **Neets (%):** (Young people not in employment, education, or training):
   - France has a high percentage of immigrant Neets, especially among the recent foreign-born population.
   - Germany, the UK, and the US also show higher percentages of Neets among immigrants compared to natives, with the US displaying less disparity.

6. **Median Income (€000s):**
   - Median income data adjusted for purchasing power parity illustrates that immigrants in France – both recent and settled – have significantly lower median incomes than native-born populations.
   - The income gap is less pronounced in Germany, the UK, and the US, although immigrants still generally have lower median incomes than natives.

Overall, the data suggests that immigrants in France face more severe socio-economic challenges compared to their counterparts in Germany, the UK, and the US, with significant disparities in poverty, income, and unemployment rates.
