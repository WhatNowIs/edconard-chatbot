The line chart illustrates the share of global savings for China, the European Union (EU), and the United States (US) from 1990 to 2024. The data reveals the following key trends:

1. **China's Dominance**: China's share of global savings has seen a significant upward trajectory since the early 2000s. By 2024, China holds the highest share, well above 25%, peaking around 30%.

2. **EU and US Trends**: In contrast, the EU and the US have maintained relatively stable shares, with both hovering around 15-20%. Their shares have fluctuated over the years but have not shown the same consistent increase as China.

3. **Crossing Point**: Around the early 2000s, China's share began to overtake that of both the EU and the US. This marked a significant shift, positioning China as a dominant global saver.

Overall, the chart underscores China's rise as a global savings superpower, outstripping both the EU and the US, which have seen relatively modest and stable shares in comparison.
