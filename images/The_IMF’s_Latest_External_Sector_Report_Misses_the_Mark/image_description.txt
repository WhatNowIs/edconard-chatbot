The image is a stacked area chart titled "Global Goods Trade: Sum of Deficits" which shows the sum of trade deficits in USD billions using trailing 4-quarter sums, spanning from Q2 2001 to Q2 2024. The data is categorized by various regions and countries including China (red), the EU (blue), NIEs (Asia) (orange), ASEAN (green), Japan (beige), and Fuel Exporters (yellow). 

Here are the key highlights:

1. **Overall Trend in Trade Deficit**:
   - The total global trade deficit has significantly fluctuated over the years, showing peaks and troughs over the given period. It reached the highest points around Q1 2010 and Q4 2021.

2. **Individual Region Analysis**:
   - **China** has consistently maintained a significant trade surplus, with this surplus increasing notably after 2005.
   - The **EU** showed consistent deficits, particularly after the global financial crisis around 2008.
   - **Fuel Exporters** demonstrated a considerable surplus, contributing significantly to the global trade surplus in specific periods.
   - The **NIEs (Asia)** and **ASEAN** regions also showed trade surpluses, although to a lesser extent compared to China and Fuel Exporters.
   - **Japan** showed a smaller, relatively steady surplus.
   
3. **Notable Periods**:
   - Around Q2 2008, there was a steep decline in global trade deficit which coincides with the global financial crisis.
   - Another significant dip can be seen around Q2 2020, likely related to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - More recent years (Q2 2021 onwards) show a rapid increase in the global trade surplus, reflecting shifting global trade dynamics.

In summary, the chart depicts the evolution of global trade deficits, indicating significant contributions from China and fuel-exporting countries to surpluses, while regions like the EU often show trade deficits. The overall dynamic has been affected by major global events such as the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.
