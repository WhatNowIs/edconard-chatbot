The image presents Figure 6, titled "Belligerents v third countries," which provides a comparative analysis of the economic impacts of wars on belligerent countries and third countries. The data spans from the year 1870 to 2022, focusing on significant wars and their effects on output and inflation.

### Key Observations:

#### (a) Belligerents
- **Output (Left Panel)**:
  - For countries engaged in war, nearby belligerents (red line) experience a significant decline in output, falling to nearly -20% from pre-war levels by year 4 and somewhat recovering by year 8, but remaining substantially below pre-war levels.
  - Distant belligerents (blue dashed line) tend to have lesser declines initially, even rising above their pre-war output, before stabilizing around 0% deviation from pre-war levels by year 6 to 8.
 
- **Inflation (Right Panel)**:
  - Nearby countries show a sharp increase in inflation, peaking around 15 percentage points above pre-war levels around year 2, then gradually declining but remaining elevated above distant belligerents.
  - Distant belligerents show relatively stable and controlled deviations in inflation, maintaining a steady rate closer to pre-war levels.

#### (b) Third countries
- **Output (Left Panel)**:
  - The impact on nearby third countries also shows a decline in output, though less severe than actual belligerents, reaching approximately -10% from pre-war levels.
  - Distant third countries have a slight rise in output initially, followed by stabilization close to 0% deviation from pre-war levels.
  
- **Inflation (Right Panel)**:
  - Nearby third countries exhibit a mild increase in inflation, with deviations peaking around 5 percentage points above pre-war levels, then declining slightly over time.
  - Distant third countries maintain a relatively stable inflation rate with minimal deviation from pre-war levels.

### Confidence Intervals:
- Shaded areas in all panels indicate 90% confidence bands, implying that the estimates are statistically significant with a 90% probability that the true values lie within these intervals.

### Summary:
The data indicates that nearby belligerents experience severe economic disruptions in both output and inflation following the onset of war. Distant belligerents are relatively less affected, maintaining more stable economic conditions. Third countries, while not directly involved in the conflict, still face economic repercussions, particularly if they are geographically or economically close to the warring regions.
