The chart titled "Great Wall of Debt" illustrates China's debt as a share of its gross domestic product (GDP) from 2010 to 2021. This debt is broken down into four categories: households (red), nonfinancial corporations (blue), central government (orange), and local governments (black).

Key points to note from the chart:
1. **Overall Debt Increase**: China's overall debt as a percentage of GDP has increased significantly over the period shown.
2. **Household Debt**: Household debt has shown a marked increase, represented by the expanding red band.
3. **Nonfinancial Corporations**: Debt from nonfinancial corporations makes up the largest portion of the total debt and remains relatively steady, depicted by the prominent blue band.
4. **Central Government**: Central government debt (orange band) remains a smaller fraction of total debt and shows slight growth.
5. **Local Governments**: Local government debt (black band) is the smallest fraction and has shown a slight increase.

The chart shows that the debt growth across all sectors has contributed to the total increase in China's debt-to-GDP ratio.
