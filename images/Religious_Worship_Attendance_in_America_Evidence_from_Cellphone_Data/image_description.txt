The bar chart titled "Figure 1: Religious Attendance Based on Self-reported vs. Cellphone Sample" compares self-reported religious attendance and religious affiliation data from Pew Research (light bars) with attendance data derived from cellphone samples (dark bars). Here is a concise summary of the key findings presented in the chart:

1. **Affiliation with a religion:** 
   - Self-reported: 65.6%.

2. **Attends at least once a year:**
   - Self-reported: 45.5%.
   - Cellphone Data: 72.7%.

3. **Attends at least once a month:**
   - Self-reported: 29.8%.
   - Cellphone Data: 20.7%.

4. **Attends at least once a week:**
   - Self-reported: 22.1%.
   - Cellphone Data: 4.6%.

The notes at the bottom explain that the light bars indicate self-reported religious attendance and affiliation based on Pew Research data, while the dark bars represent religious attendance as captured by cellphone data, focusing on visits during the primary days of worship.

**Summary:**
The data reveals discrepancies between self-reported religious attendance and cellphone-based attendance records. While more Americans report being affiliated with a religion and attending services at least once a week or a month, cellphone data indicates a higher annual attendance but significantly lower weekly and monthly attendance rates. This suggests potential over-reporting in self-reported data or limitations in cellphone data tracking.
