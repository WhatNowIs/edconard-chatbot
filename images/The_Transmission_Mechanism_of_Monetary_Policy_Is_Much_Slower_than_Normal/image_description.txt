The image provided is a chart titled "The transmission mechanism of monetary policy is much slower because of the mortgage lock-in effect." It shows the share of mortgages outstanding by volume from March 2013 to November 2023, with two distinct lines representing the share of mortgages below 4% and the share of mortgages above 6%. 

Key points from the chart:

1. **Share of Mortgages Below 4%:**
   - In March 2013, around 30% of mortgages were below 4%.
   - This share gradually increased, peaking at 70% around March 2022, at which time the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates.
   - As of November 2023, the share of mortgages below 4% slightly decreased and stands at approximately 63%.

2. **Share of Mortgages Above 6%:**
   - In March 2013, approximately 25% of mortgages were above 6%.
   - This share decreased consistently until March 2022, where it reached around 2%.
   - Following the interest rate hikes starting in March 2022, the share of mortgages above 6% began to increase and by November 2023, it stands at about 10%.

3. **Mortgage Lock-in Effect:**
   - The chart highlights a significant increase in the share of mortgages under 4% even as the Federal Reserve started to raise interest rates in March 2022.
   - This indicates that many homeowners refinanced their mortgages to lower rates pre-hike, contributing to a slower transmission mechanism of monetary policy.

4. **Overall Trend:**
   - There is a notable shift in mortgage shares, influenced by Federal Reserve interest rate policies.
   - As rates increased, the share of mortgages locked in at lower rates remained high, slowing down the overall impact of the rising interest rate environment on existing mortgage holders.

The chart effectively illustrates how the mortgage lock-in effect can dampen the transmission mechanism of monetary policy changes, complicating efforts to manage economic outcomes through interest rate adjustments.
