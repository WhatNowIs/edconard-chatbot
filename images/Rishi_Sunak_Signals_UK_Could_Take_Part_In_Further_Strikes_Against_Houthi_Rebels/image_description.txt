The chart is titled "The 'peace dividend' has helped fund other popular spending priorities" and depicts the trend in defense spending as a multiple of healthcare spending for the US and the UK from 1970 to 2020.

Key points from the chart:

1. **Overall Trend**: Both the US and the UK show a significant decline in defense spending relative to healthcare spending over the period from 1970 to 2020.

2. **US Defense Spending**:
   - In 1970, US defense spending was considerably higher than healthcare spending, with a multiple above 2.5.
   - A sharp decline is observed during the 1970s and 1980s.
   - By around 1990, US defense and healthcare spending reached parity (a multiple of 1.0).
   - Post-1990, defense spending continued to decrease relative to healthcare spending, stabilizing around 0.5 by 2020.

3. **UK Defense Spending**:
   - In 1970, UK defense spending started below the US level but followed a similar declining trend.
   - By the mid-1980s, UK defense and healthcare spending were roughly equal.
   - Post-1990, defense spending relative to healthcare spending continued to decline, with slight fluctuations, stabilizing slightly below 0.5 by 2020.
