The image titled "A Scale of Life" illustrates the Estimated Assembly Index (AI) of various substances, categorizing them into non-biological and biological groups. The AI was determined by researchers through repeated measurements of the substances' molecular structures. Only biologically produced molecules displayed an AI above a certain threshold.

**Non-Biological Substances:**
- **Coal:** AI ranges from 10 to 12.
- **Quartz:** AI ranges from 11 to 12.
- **Granite:** AI ranges from 10 to 15.

**Biological Substances:**
- **Yeast:** AI ranges from 10 to 24.
- **Urine:** AI ranges from 9 to 27.
- **Seawater:** AI ranges from 9 to 28.
- **E. coli:** AI ranges from 15 to 31.
- **Beer:** AI ranges from 10 to 34.

The chart reveals that non-biological substances generally have lower AI values, while biological substances exhibit higher AI values, indicating the complexity of their molecular structures.
