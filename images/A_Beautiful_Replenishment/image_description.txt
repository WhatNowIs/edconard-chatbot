The graph depicts three key items from the Federal Reserveâ€™s balance sheet, measured in billions of dollars, over the period from January 1, 2023, to July 1, 2023. The items include Reserves, Reverse Repos (RRP), and Treasury General Account (RHS).

- **Reserves**: Represented by the orange line, the reserves started the year around $3,100 billion, experienced some fluctuations, but remained relatively stable, ending slightly below the starting value.
- **RRP (Reverse Repos)**: Shown as the grey line, RRP began around $2,300 billion and steadily declined over the period, ending at just over $400 billion.
- **Treasury General Account**: Represented by the blue line and using the right-hand scale (RHS) for values, it began the period around $1,900 billion, but experienced a sharp decline until a significant rise in the last part of the period, ending closer to $600 billion.

The red circle emphasizes the intersection and significant shift where the Treasury General Account rises above the RRP towards the end of the period.

**Summary**: 

Over the first half of 2023, the Federal Reserve saw:
- Relative stability in Reserve levels, hovering around $3,000 billion.
- A sharp decline in Reverse Repo Agreements from approximately $2,300 billion to just over $400 billion.
- An initial decline in Treasury General Account balances, followed by a notable increase towards the end of the period, ending around $600 billion.
