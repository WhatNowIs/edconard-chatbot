This chart, titled "Exhibit 2: Total retail spending per household as measured by Bank of America debit and credit card data in select, combined CBDs as of July 2023," presents a comparative analysis of retail spending patterns in select Central Business Districts (CBDs) from January 2020 to July 2023. The spending data is indexed to a 2019 average (set as 100) and utilizes a 3-month moving average.

The blue line represents data from Tampa, Phoenix, Orlando, Nashville, Jacksonville, Columbus, Charlotte, and Austin; the red line represents data from New York, Boston, San Francisco, and Atlanta. 

Key Highlights:
- Both groups saw a significant drop in retail spending per household at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (early 2020).
- Post-pandemic recovery shows a divergence: 
  - **Blue-line cities (Tampa and others)**: These cities experienced a more robust recovery, eventually surpassing the 2019 average and maintaining higher spending levels through 2022 and 2023.
  - **Red-line cities (New York and others)**: These cities exhibited a less pronounced recovery. Although they showed some improvement during 2021, their spending remained consistently below the 2019 average thereafter.
- Recent trends (as of mid-2023) suggest that the blue-line cities continue to have stronger retail spending compared to the red-line cities.

This data indicates that retail spending in select CBDs with net population losses as of Q2 2023 has lagged, particularly in New York, Boston, San Francisco, and Atlanta, compared to other cities like Tampa and Phoenix.
