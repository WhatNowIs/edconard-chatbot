The image is a line graph showing the cumulative beta over different quarters into the tightening cycle. The graph tracks four distinct time periods: 1993-1995, 2004-2007, 2015-2019, and 2022. Each period is represented by differently colored and styled lines:

1. **1993-1995 (Light Blue Circles)**:
   - Starts from 1994q4 and ends in 1995q2.
   - Shows a cumulative beta increase from approximately 0.1 to 0.25 over 2-6 quarters.

2. **2004-2007 (Red Diamonds)**:
   - Begins in 2004q4 and concludes in 2006q3.
   - Indicates a steady and significant rise in cumulative beta from about 0.2 to 0.5 over 2-12 quarters.

3. **2015-2019 (Brown Triangles)**:
   - Starts in 2016q3 and extends to 2018q3.
   - Demonstrates a gradual increase in cumulative beta from nearly 0 to 0.3 over 2-12 quarters.

4. **2022 (Dark Blue Squares)**:
   - Initiated in 2022q1 and has data up to 2022q2.
   - Shows a sharp rise in cumulative beta from 0 to almost 0.2 in just 2 quarters.

**Summary**:
The graph illustrates the cumulative beta behavior over various periods of tightening cycles. The period 2004-2007 shows the highest and most sustained increase in cumulative beta. The most recent period, 2022, shows a very rapid initial rise in beta within just two quarters. The cycles from 1993-1995 and 2015-2019 show more gradual increases compared to more recent data (2022). This data could be analyzed for understanding market behavior and risks associated with different tightening cycles.
