The image is a graph from the Financial Times illustrating the daily reported COVID-19 cases in China. It covers data from January 1 to November 22. Here are the key points:

- The graph shows two significant peaks in the number of daily reported COVID-19 cases.
- The first peak occurred around early April, surpassing 25,000 daily cases.
- After the first peak, there was a sharp decline in cases around late April and early May.
- From May to mid-October, the number of daily cases remained relatively low, fluctuating between 0 and around 2,500.
- From mid-October, the number of daily cases started to rise significantly again.
- By late November, the daily reported cases are approaching previous peak levels seen during the Shanghai outbreak, once again surpassing 25,000 daily cases.

The trend depicted in the graph suggests that the current COVID-19 outbreak in China is set to surpass the levels observed during the peak of the Shanghai outbreak earlier in the year.
