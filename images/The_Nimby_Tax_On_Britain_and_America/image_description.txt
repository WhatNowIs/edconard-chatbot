The infographic provides a comparative analysis of the cost per mile for recently completed or ongoing infrastructure projects in various countries, using 2023 prices in millions of pounds (£mn). It highlights that the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) generally incur higher infrastructure costs compared to other countries like France, Japan, and Germany. Here's a detailed summary:

1. **High-Speed Rail**:
   - The UK has some of the highest costs, with notable examples like HS2 reaching around £400 million per mile.
   - Japan and France have significantly lower costs.

2. **New Tram Lines**:
   - The UK also shows high costs for new tram lines, around £200 million per mile, while France's costs are notably lower, averaging below £100 million per mile.

3. **Electrification of Existing Rail**:
   - Electrification projects in the UK are costlier compared to France, with the UK costs exceeding £15 million per mile in many cases, while France's costs are mostly under £10 million per mile.

4. **New Road Tunnels**:
   - Both the UK and US have high costs for new road tunnels, with some US projects exceeding £1,500 million per mile. France and Germany show significantly lower costs.

5. **New Motorway Bridges**:
   - The UK and US again exhibit higher costs for new motorway bridges, reaching nearly £1,500 million per mile. France and other countries remain below this threshold.

6. **New Road Lanes**:
   - The cost for new road lanes is high in both the UK and US, with costs ranging broadly up to £100 million per mile. Germany's costs are relatively lower.

Overall, infrastructure projects in the UK and US are markedly more expensive compared to their counterparts in other countries, indicating potential inefficiencies or higher cost structures in these regions.
