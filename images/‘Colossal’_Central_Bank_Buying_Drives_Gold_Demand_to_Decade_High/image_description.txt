This chart, sourced from Metals Focus, Refinitiv GFMS, and the World Gold Council, tracks central bank gold purchases and sales in tonnes from 1950 through 2022. The blue bars above the zero line represent purchases, while the light blue bars below the zero line indicate sales.

Key takeaways:

1. **1950-1960s**: There were significant gold sales, particularly notable in the early 1960s.
2. **Late 1960s to early 1970s**: A dramatic surge in gold purchases occurred, peaking above 1,000 tonnes around the late 1960s. 
3. **1980s to 2000s**: Predominantly a period of gold sales by central banks, with consistent negative bars signaling consistent offloading of gold reserves.
4. **Post-2008 Financial Crisis**: There was a shift towards gold accumulation, with increasing purchases especially after 2009, and continuing into the 2010s.
5. **2022**: Central bank gold purchases reached their highest level since 1967, exceeding 1,000 tonnes.

The chart illustrates a significant recent trend of central banks buying more gold, reversing a lengthy period of selling and highlighting increased interest in gold as a reserve asset.
