This image, titled "Figure 1: Adult life expectancy for Americans with and without a college degree," presents a graph showing the trends in life expectancy at age 25 for two distinct groups: individuals with a four-year college degree and those without.

### Key Points:
- **Timeline**: The graph covers the period from 1990 to 2020.
- **Life Expectancy at Age 25**:
  - **With a College Degree**: 
    - In the early 1990s, life expectancy started at around 54 years.
    - It showed a general rising trend, peaking just below 59 years in the late 2010s.
    - There is a noticeable decline near 2020.
  - **Without a College Degree**: 
    - It began at approximately 51.5 years in the early 1990s.
    - Experienced a gradual increase over time, reaching about 53 years in the late 2010s.
    - There is a sharp decline in the years leading up to 2020.

### Observations:
- **Disparity**: Throughout the period, individuals with a college degree consistently have a higher life expectancy compared to those without.
- **Growth Periods**: 
  - Both groups showed improvements in life expectancy through the 1990s and 2000s.
- **Recent Decline**: Life expectancy for both groups shows a marked decrease as it approaches 2020, with the decline being particularly steep for those without a college degree.

### Summary:
Over the past three decades, there has been a notable and consistent gap in life expectancy between American adults with and without a four-year college degree. Those with a college degree have enjoyed longer life spans, increasingly so until a peak around the late 2010s. However, both groups have experienced a concerning decline in life expectancy as they approached 2020, highlighting potential emerging health crises or socio-economic challenges affecting all demographics.
