The image contains six line graphs comparing different economic and demographic indices across the G7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, US) and Spain from 1990 to 2019.

1. **Top Left (GDP Index: 1990=100)**: 
   - All countries display an upward trend in GDP from 1990 to 2019.
   - The US, Canada, and Germany seem to have a higher growth rate, especially post-2000.

2. **Top Right (Population 15-64/Total Population)**:
   - There is a general downward trend in the working-age population (15-64) as a share of the total population in most countries.
   - Japan shows a significant decline, while France and the US have relatively stable ratios.

3. **Middle Left (GDP/Population Index: 1990=100)**:
   - GDP per capita has generally increased across all countries.
   - The UK and US exhibit strong growth rates, especially after the mid-1990s.

4. **Middle Right (Population Index: 1990=100)**:
   - The overall population index shows an increase, though at varying rates.
   - The US, Canada, and the UK have more pronounced growth, whereas Japan and Italy show slower growth.

5. **Bottom Left (GDP/(Population 15-64) Index: 1990=100)**:
   - GDP per working-age population index shows significant growth for most countries.
   - The US, UK, and Canada stand out in terms of higher growth.

6. **Bottom Right (Population 15-64 Index: 1990=100)**:
   - The working-age population index is rising for most countries, but Japan exhibits a decline.
   - The US and UK display more rapid growth compared to the others.

**Summary**:
From 1990 to 2019, the GDP and GDP per capita indices indicate that economies in the G7 and Spain have generally grown, with the US, Canada, and the UK showing particularly strong performance. However, demographic shifts, particularly a declining working-age population as a share of the total population in several countries (notably Japan), imply potential future economic challenges. The overall population is increasing, but the working-age population trends notably diverge, suggesting significant differences in demographic dynamics among these countries.
