The image provides a table (Table 2) titled "Estimates and Implied Parameters," outlining various parameters under different categories related to the application frequency for Automation, Health, and Energy over 5-year and 10-year periods.

### Summary:

**Application Frequency Categories:**
1. **Automation:**
   - **5-year:** (1)
   - **10-year:** (2)
2. **Health:**
   - **5-year:** (3)
   - **10-year:** (4)
3. **Energy:**
   - **5-year:** (5)
   - **10-year:** (6)

**Key Data Points:**

- **Panel C: Equilibrium and Welfare Comparison**
  - **n_SP / n_EQ:**
    - Automation:
      - 5-year: 0.82
      - 10-year: 0.79
    - Health:
      - 5-year: 0.43
      - 10-year: 0.45
    - Energy:
      - 5-year: 0.44
      - 10-year: 0.57
  - **U_SP - U_EQ:**
    - Automation:
      - 5-year: 0.01
      - 10-year: 0.01
    - Health:
      - 5-year: 0.06
      - 10-year: 0.06
    - Energy:
      - 5-year: 0.03
      - 10-year: 0.02

- **Panel D: Equilibrium and Welfare Comparison (Alternatives)**
  - **n_SP / n_EQ:**
    - Automation:
      - 5-year: 0.91
      - 10-year: 0.89
    - Health:
      - 5-year: 0.58
      - 10-year: 0.59
    - Energy:
      - 5-year: 0.00
      - 10-year: 0.00
  - **U_SP - U_EQ:**
    - Automation:
      - 5-year: 0.002
      - 10-year: 0.002
    - Health:
      - 5-year: 0.18
      - 10-year: 0.17
    - Energy:
      - 5-year: 13.74
      - 10-year: 8.94

### Interpretation:

- **n_SP / n_EQ** represents some ratio of parameters under study across different application frequencies and categories.
- **U_SP - U_EQ** shows the difference in utility (or some measure of welfare) under specific conditions.
- In **Panel C**, the highest n_SP/n_EQ values are seen in Automation (5-year, 0.82; 10-year, 0.79) while the lowest is in Health (5-year, 0.43).
- In **Panel D**, Automation shows the lowest U_SP - U_EQ values (very close to 0), whereas Energy presents the highest differences in the 5-year (13.74) and 10-year (8.94) points.

Overall, this table provides detailed estimates and implied parameters to compare Equilibrium and Welfare across different application frequencies and sectors.
