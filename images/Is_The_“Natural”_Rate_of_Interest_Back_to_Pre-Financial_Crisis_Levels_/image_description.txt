This chart depicts the Natural Real Interest Rate over a period from October 1, 1990, to December 1, 2021, using two different models: Holston-Laubach-Williams (blue line) and Lubik-Mathes (orange line).

### Summary:

1. **Time Period**: The chart covers over 30 years, from late 1990 to the end of 2021.
2. **Natural Real Interest Rate Trends**:
    - **Holston-Laubach-Williams (Blue Line)**: 
        - The rate starts at around 3% in 1990, peaking at approximately 4% in the mid-1990s.
        - It shows a declining trend from the late 1990s, continuing steadily through the early 2000s.
        - A significant drop occurs around 2008-2009 during the financial crisis, followed by a gradual decline.
        - In recent years leading up to 2021, the rate stabilizes and hovers around 1%.
    - **Lubik-Mathes (Orange Line)**:
        - This rate starts higher than the blue line in 1990 at around 2%, slowly rising to around 3% in the mid-1990s.
        - A steady decline is observed from the early 2000s, dropping sharply around 2008-2009.
        - It stabilizes at lower levels around 0-1% post-crisis, with notable fluctuations in recent years, peaking again during the COVID-19 pandemic period.
3. **Key Observations**:
    - Both models show a similar long-term declining trend in the Natural Real Interest Rate.
    - The drop during the 2008-2009 financial crisis is evident in both models, indicating a major economic impact.
    - Recent fluctuations in the Lubik-Mathes model highlight the economic uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Overall, the chart highlights significant economic events and the declining trend of the Natural Real Interest Rate over time, with variations between the two analytical models.
