The chart illustrates the dividends paid by money market funds over time and their share of annual consumer spending. As of the latest data, money market funds are distributing approximately $500 billion in dividends, which equates to 2.5% of annual consumer spending. 

Key observations from the chart:

- From June 2004 to mid-2008, dividends saw a significant increase, peaking just below $500 billion.
- Post the financial crisis of 2008-2009, depicted by the shaded area, there was a sharp decline in dividends, hitting a low around 2010 and remaining low throughout the 2010s.
- Starting around mid-2020, there has been a notable uptick in dividends, reaching around $500 billion by the latest data.
- The share of consumer spending that these dividends represent has also climbed sharply in recent years, matching the distribution increase.
  
This indicates a resurgence in money market fund performance and relevance in the financial ecosystem, significantly impacting consumer spending proportions.
