This figure illustrates the decline in the disruptiveness of scientific papers and patents over several decades, indicating that recent work tends to build upon existing knowledge rather than introducing groundbreaking innovations.

**Figure 2: Decline of disruptive science and technology**

**From: Papers and patents are becoming less disruptive over time**

**a. Papers**
- X-axis: Year (1945 - 2010)
- Y-axis: Average CD₅ (a measure of disruptiveness, where higher values indicate more disruptive work)
- Fields:
  - Life sciences and biomedicine (Blue)
  - Physical sciences (Green)
  - Social sciences (Orange)
  - Technology (Red)

**b. Patents**
- X-axis: Year (1980 - 2010)
- Y-axis: Average CD₅
- Fields:
  - Chemical (Blue)
  - Computers and communications (Green)
  - Drugs and medical (Red)
  - Electrical and electronic (Purple)
  - Mechanical (Yellow)

**Summary:**
1. **Papers (1945-2010):** All categories show a notable decline in average CD₅, indicating a transition from highly disruptive work to more incremental, accumulative research. The magnitude of decline spans 91.9% (social sciences) to 100% (physical sciences).

2. **Patents (1980-2010):** A similar decline is observed across all technology categories, with a range from 93.5% (computers and communications) to 96.4% (drugs and medical).

3. **Confidence Intervals:** Shaded bands indicate the 95% confidence intervals, emphasizing the robustness of this downward trend even after accounting for changes in publication, citation, and authorship practices.

Overall, this figure highlights a significant reduction in the disruptiveness of both scientific papers and patents over time, demonstrating a shift toward more gradual scientific and technological advancements.
