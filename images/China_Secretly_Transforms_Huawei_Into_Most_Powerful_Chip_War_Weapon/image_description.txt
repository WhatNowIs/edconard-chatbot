The image outlines the efforts to build a self-sufficient chip network centered around Huawei, supported by a state investment fund, the Shenzhen Major Industry Investment Group. Here's a summary:

1. **Central Role**: The Shenzhen Major Industry Investment Group acts as the central body coordinating various entities involved in chip fabrication and semiconductor development.

2. **Major Collaborators**:
   - **Chip Fabrication Manufacturers**:
     - **PXW**: Focuses on image sensors and RF (radio frequency) chips.
     - **SWAYSURE**: Produces memory chips.
     - **PST**: Develops logic chips.

3. **Semi-Conductor Developers**: 
   - **MITK**: Specializes in third-generation chip development.

4. **Consultants**:
   - **PENGJIN**: Engages in tech transfer.

5. **Chip Making Machines and Materials**:
   - **SICARRIER**: Deals with chip making machinery and materials and has subsidiaries like:
     - **CORNERSTONE**: Photoresist.
     - **ZETOP**: Optical machines.
     - **UEASCEND**: Chip equipment.

6. **Collaboration with Huawei**:
   - The three key chipmakers (PXW, SWAYSURE, and PST) are building new fabrication facilities in conjunction with Huawei.
   - Huawei and SICARRIER have exchanged both staff and patents to bolster their efforts.

This network aims to create a sustainable and self-reliant ecosystem for chip manufacturing, enhancing Huaweiâ€™s capabilities in producing advanced semiconductor technologies.
