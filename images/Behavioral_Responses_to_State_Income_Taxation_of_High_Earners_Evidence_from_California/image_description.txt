The image consists of two line graphs titled "Matched Sample Income Trends" which illustrate annual group averages for both logs and levels of AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) and Taxable Income spanning the years 2009 to 2014. These graphs compare income trends for two groups: Non-Resident Filers (represented by red solid lines) and California Residents (represented by blue dashed lines).

1. **Left Graph - CA Taxable Income:**
   - The taxable income for both groups has an overall increasing trend from 2009 to 2014.
   - There is a noticeable peak in taxable income for both groups in 2012 and subsequent drops in 2013.
   - Non-Resident Filers generally exhibit slightly higher taxable incomes compared to California Residents throughout the period, with a more pronounced increase in 2012.

2. **Right Graph - AGI:**
   - AGI trends for both groups are almost parallel to the taxable income trends.
   - AGI shows an overall increase from 2009 to 2014 with noticeable peaks in 2012.
   - The pattern is slightly more pronounced for Non-Resident Filers compared to California Residents.

**Filing Status Key:**
- Red solid line: Non-Resident Filers
- Blue dashed line: California Residents

**Note:**
- The figure uses averages to match levels of income across 2009-2010.
- Parallel trends or their lack in 2009-2010 and their continuation in 2011 are not results of the matching procedure.
