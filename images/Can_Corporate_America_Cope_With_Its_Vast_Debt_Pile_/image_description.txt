The Financial Times graphic reveals that over $3 trillion in debt will require refinancing in the coming years. The line chart delineates the five-year maturities (represented in billions of dollars) of three types of bonds from 2012 to 2022:

1. **Speculative-grade bank loans (represented with a dark blue line):**
   - Steady increase from 2012 to around 2018.
   - Rapid growth from 2018 onwards, peaking at nearly 1000 billion dollars by 2022.

2. **Investment-grade bonds (represented with a light blue line):**
   - Steady rise until almost 2018.
   - Significant peak around 2020, followed by a decline and then a sharp rise, attaining a level of over 1000 billion dollars in 2022.

3. **High-yield bonds (represented with a pink line):**
   - Gradual growth from 2012 to 2018.
   - Slight decline and stabilization around 2019-2021.
   - Subsequent increase near the end of the period, approaching 500 billion dollars in 2022.

Overall, the graphic underscores the substantial need for debt refinancing, with speculative-grade bank loans and investment-grade bonds showing the most significant growth, alluding to the increased liabilities due to the economic impacts of Covid-19. The data source is Moodyâ€™s, combining two readings for 2020 due to the pandemic.
