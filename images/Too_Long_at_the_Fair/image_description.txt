The chart titled "Largest Europe P/E discount vs US in Q3 2022" shows the relative P/E (Price-to-Earnings) discount based on forward earnings between Europe and the US. The two data sources compared are Bloomberg (brown line) and Datastream (blue line).

Key points from the chart:
1. **Overall Trend**: From 2006 to 2022, Europe has generally had a significant P/E discount compared to the US, as indicated by the negative percentages throughout the period.
2. **Lowest Points**: Around 2011 and again in 2022, there are noticeable dips where the discount peaked, reaching almost -40% in 2022.
3. **Less Discount Over Time**: There are periods where the discount decreases (becomes less negative) such as briefly around 2016 and 2021.
4. **Consistency**: Both data sources, Bloomberg and Datastream, show similar trends although there are minor differences in the magnitude and timing of specific points.
5. **Recent Changes**: In Q3 2022, the P/E discount was significantly high but started showing signs of narrowing slightly towards the end of 2022.

The data suggests that European stocks were significantly cheaper relative to US stocks during much of the analyzed period, particularly noticeable during times of economic stress or uncertainty.
