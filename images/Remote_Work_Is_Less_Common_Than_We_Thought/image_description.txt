The image presents a line graph depicting the gap between CPS (Current Population Survey) and WFH (Work From Home) Research estimates of hybrid work shares from October 2022 to August 2023. The graph includes four distinct lines:

1. **Hybrid (WFH Research)**: This line starts at about 30% in October 2022, fluctuates slightly with minor ups and downs, and ends near 30% in August 2023.
2. **Fully Remote (WFH Research)**: This line begins around 15% in October 2022, exhibits slight dips and rises throughout the period, and concludes just below 15% in August 2023.
3. **Fully Remote (CPS)**: This line starts just above 10% in October 2022, remains fairly stable with minor variations, and ends in August 2023 slightly above its starting point.
4. **Hybrid (CPS)**: This line starts just below 10% in October 2022, shows minimal fluctuation, and ends slightly above its starting point in August 2023.

**Summary:**

The graph illustrates the divergence between CPS and WFH Research estimates of hybrid and fully remote work shares over an eleven-month period. The WFH Research consistently reports higher percentages for both hybrid and fully remote work compared to CPS estimates. The hybrid work share according to WFH Research hovers around 30%, while CPS estimates it just below 10%. For fully remote work, WFH Research estimates remain near 15%, whereas CPS estimates are stable slightly above 10%. Overall, the data indicates a notable discrepancy between the two sources, with WFH Research consistently showing higher estimates for both work models.
