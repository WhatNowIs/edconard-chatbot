The image depicts a graph titled "Global Supply Chain Pressure Index Returning to Historical Average on Pause". The graph spans the years from 1997 to 2021. The y-axis measures the standard deviations from the average value of supply chain pressure.

Key points:
1. Between 1997 and 2007, the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index fluctuates around the average value, slightly below zero at times.
2. Significant increases are observable around 2008 during the financial crisis, and then a drop follows.
3. From 2010 to mid-2019, the index shows fluctuations but remains relatively close to the historical average, with slight peaks in between.
4. Starting in 2020, the index rises sharply, peaking between a standard deviation of 4 and 5, indicating unprecedented supply chain pressure likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
5. By mid-2021, the index begins to descend back towards the historical average, signaling a decrease in the extraordinary pressure experienced.

Summary:
The graph illustrates the fluctuations in the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index from 1997 to 2021. After remaining relatively stable and close to the average for two decades, the index saw a sharp spike in 2020, peaking between 4 and 5 standard deviations above average, largely attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on global supply chains. By mid-2021, the pressure index starts returning towards historical norms as the pandemic-related disruptions begin to settle.
