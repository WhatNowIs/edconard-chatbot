This chart from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York illustrates the median one-, three-, and five-year ahead expected inflation rates over the period from 2013 to 2022. Here is a summary of the key points:

1. **Trend Overview**:
   - From 2013 to 2020, the one-year, three-year, and five-year inflation expectations remained relatively stable, fluctuating within a narrow band around 2-4%.
   - A significant increase in all these expectations can be observed starting in 2021.

2. **One-Year Ahead Expectations**:
   - The blue line indicates the median one-year ahead inflation expectation.
   - This measure spiked sharply beginning around mid-2021, reaching a peak close to 10% before showing a slight decline towards the end of 2022.

3. **Three-Year Ahead Expectations**:
   - The red line represents median three-year ahead inflation expectations.
   - Although experiencing minor fluctuations, this measure remained relatively stable until 2021 when it started an upward trend, but not as pronounced as the one-year expectations. By 2022, it remained below the peak levels of the one-year expectations.

4. **Five-Year Ahead Expectations**:
   - The yellow line denotes median five-year ahead inflation expectations.
   - This expectation also remained mostly stable over the years but experienced a modest rise from 2021. The increase is more subdued compared to the one- and three-year ahead expectations, suggesting longer-term inflation expectations are relatively anchored.

5. **Key Periods**:
   - **Pre-2020**: Stable expectations around 2-4%.
   - **2021-2022**: Noticeable rise in expectations, with one-year ahead peaking sharply followed by three-year, and then five-year expectations.

In summary, inflation expectations were relatively stable from 2013 to 2020 but saw significant increases starting in 2021, likely reflecting economic disruptions and uncertainty during and post the COVID-19 pandemic. One-year ahead expectations showed the most dramatic rise, while three-year and five-year expectations also increased but to a lesser extent, indicating greater uncertainty or concerns about shorter-term inflation.
