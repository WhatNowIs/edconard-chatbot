The infographic forecasts the shifts in the global chip manufacturing market from 2022 to 2032, influenced by the US Chips Act. Here are the key points:

1. **Overall US Market Share**: In 2022, the US holds a 10% share of worldwide fab capacity. By 2032, this is projected to increase to 14%, attributed largely to the US Chips Act. Without this Act, US share would have slid to 8%.

2. **Leading-edge Logic (below 10 nanometers)**:
   - **2022**: Dominated mostly by Taiwan and South Korea.
   - **2032**: The US share increases, with the presence of Taiwan and South Korea still strongly significant.

3. **DRAM Memory**:
   - **2022 & 2032**: Mostly controlled by South Korea, with significant shares owned by Taiwan and Mainland China. The US share increases slightly by 2032.

4. **Packaging**:
   - **2022**: Dominated by Taiwan, followed by Mainland China, with smaller contributions from the US, South Korea, and Japan.
   - **2032**: The US share increases noticeably, with Taiwan remaining the leader. Contributions from Mainland China and others adjust slightly.

5. **Mature-node Logic (28 nm or above)**:
   - **2022**: Significant share held by Mainland China, with notable contributions from Taiwan, the US, and Japan.
   - **2032**: Mainland China maintains a strong presence, but the US share increases modestly, while contributions from Taiwan and Japan adjust.

Overall, the projection suggests that the US will gain a larger share of the global chip manufacturing market by 2032 across various logic and memory chip segments, while other key players such as Taiwan and South Korea maintain their dominance in leading-edge technologies.
