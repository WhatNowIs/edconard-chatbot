The image contains Figure 2, which depicts data on national industrial concentration through two metrics: Employment and Sales. The key findings and graphical representations are summarized as follows:

1. **Graph Panels**:
   - **Left Panel (Employment)**: Shows the average national Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) across six-digit NAICS industries, weighted by their share of employment each year from 1990 to 2020.
   - **Right Panel (Sales)**: Displays the average national HHI weighted by the industry's share of sales in a given year from 1990 to 2020.

2. **Legend and Key Data Points**:
   - *National HHI (blue circles)*: Represents the overall change in national concentration.
   - *National HHI with fixed sector-weights (red triangles)*: Keeps the weight of each of the six selected sectors (Utilities and Transportation, Manufacturing, Services, Retail Trade, Wholesale Trade, and Finance) fixed at its 1992 levels.
   - *National HHI with fixed industry-weights (green squares)*: Fixes the weights of each six-digit NAICS industry at its 1992 level.

3. **HHI Scaling and Trends**:
   - The HHI has an upper bound of 100 in these charts.
   - Both the employment and sales HHI show an increasing trend from 1990 to 2020, suggesting growing national industrial concentration over three decades.
   - In the employment data (left panel), the index rises from around 2.5 in 1990 to about 4.5 in 2020.
   - In the sales data (right panel), the index increases from approximately 4.5 in 1990 to around 7 in 2020.
   - Different weighting methods (sector-weights and industry-weights) present a more nuanced perspective on the concentration trends over the years.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The data indicates a clear upward trend in industrial concentration in the United States across various sectors between 1990 and 2020, driven by both employment and sales metrics.

These findings suggest that fewer firms are increasingly dominating employment and sales in multiple industries, reflecting greater market concentration.
