This image is a scatter plot that illustrates the relationship between the number of severe-weather events and the resulting insurance-industry losses for the first half of each year from 2010 to 2023. The plot divides the data into four quadrants based on the averages for both metrics. 

Key points from the chart:

1. **Axes**:
   - The horizontal axis represents the number of severe-weather events.
   - The vertical axis represents losses in the insurance industry, adjusted for inflation, measured in billions of dollars.

2. **Quadrants**:
   - Top-left: Below average for events, above average for losses.
   - Top-right: Above average for events and losses.
   - Bottom-left: Below average for events and losses.
   - Bottom-right: Above average for events, below average for losses.

3. **Data Points**:
   - Each dot represents a year from 2010 to 2023, with labels provided for 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.
   - The average for 2010-2023 is marked by a dotted line.

4. **Trends**:
   - Recent years (2020, 2022, 2023) are clustered in the top-right quadrant, indicating that both severe-weather events and associated losses are above average for those years.
   - 2023, in particular, is notable for having the highest number of events and losses.
   - 2021 shows relatively high events but moderate losses, while years 2020 and 2022 exhibit both high events and losses.
   - Earlier years generally fall into the bottom-left quadrant, signalling fewer than average events and losses.

5. **Observation**:
   - The overall trend suggests that severe-weather events are happening more frequently and resulting in greater financial losses over time.
