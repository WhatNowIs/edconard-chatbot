The chart titled "A. Total Securities Holdings as % of GDP" displays the proportion of total securities holdings relative to GDP for several countries from January 2019 to July 2023. The countries represented are Australia, Canada, EA (Euro Area), New Zealand, Sweden, UK, and the US.

Key points:

1. Significant Increase Post-Jan 2020:
   - Early 2020 saw a substantial increase in securities holdings as a percentage of GDP, especially for the US, UK, and Euro Area. The increase is likely due to monetary responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. Peak and Decline:
   - The US, UK, and Euro Area peaked around mid-2021, with the US reaching nearly 35%, UK around 30%, and the EA just above 35%. Post the peak, a gradual decline is observed in these regions.

3. Consistent Trends:
   - Canada and Sweden demonstrate modest increases and generally maintain a lower percentage compared to the US, UK, and EA, with peaks slightly above 20% for Canada and below 20% for Sweden.

4. Australia and New Zealand:
   - They show a noticeable increase during the pandemic, with New Zealand rising significantly compared to Australia. Both countries see a decline post-peak, with New Zealand's holdings falling more sharply.

5. General Decline Post-Peak:
   - Post mid-2021, most countries show a downward trend, indicating a reduction in securities holdings as a percentage of GDP, possibly due to economic recovery and policy normalization.

This chart reflects the broader monetary policy shifts, particularly aggressive asset purchases during the pandemic for stabilization, and subsequent normalization as economies recover.
