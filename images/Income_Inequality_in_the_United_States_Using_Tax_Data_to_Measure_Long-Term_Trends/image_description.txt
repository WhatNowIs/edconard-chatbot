This image presents a comparison of the top 1% shares of national income over time, both pre-tax and after-tax, using two different methodologies: PSZ (Piketty, Saez, and Zucman) and Auten-Splinter.

**Graph A (Left) - Pre-tax national income: Top 1% share**
- The PSZ series (blue line) demonstrates a notable increase in the top 1% share of pre-tax income, peaking around 20% in recent years.
- The Auten-Splinter series (red line) shows a more moderate increase, peaking around 14%.
- For context, the Piketty-Saez series (gray dashed line) remains relatively flat in comparison.

**Graph B (Right) - After-tax national income: Top 1% share**
- The PSZ series again shows a significant increase, with the top 1% share nearing 16% by 2020.
- The Auten-Splinter series rises more gradually, peaking around 10%.
  
**Figure Notes:**
- Adjustments for estimating the Auten-Splinter pre-tax and after-tax incomes are detailed in accompanying tables and an online appendix.
- The Piketty-Saez series excludes capital gains to align more closely with national income.
- Sources include authors' calculations, Piketty and Saez data, and updated series from Piketty, Saez, and Zucman (2018, with updates as of Oct. 2021).

**Summary:**
The charts illustrate diverging trends in the share of national income held by the top 1%, depending on the methodology used. PSZ data indicate a sharp increase in income concentration both pre-tax and after-tax, while Auten-Splinter data suggests a less pronounced rise. This demonstrates the importance of methodological differences in economic analysis and their impacts on understanding inequality trends.
