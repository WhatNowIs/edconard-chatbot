The image displays a scatter plot titled "Figure 1. National Relationship Between Block-Group Density and Telework." The graph illustrates the relationship between population density percentiles of block groups in metropolitan areas and the mean share of teleworkable jobs in these block groups.

Key Points:
- **Axes**: 
  - The horizontal axis (x-axis) represents the population and density percentile of block groups, ranging from 1 (least dense) to 100 (most dense).
  - The vertical axis (y-axis) represents the mean share of teleworkable jobs, ranging from 0.325 to 0.425.
- **Data Points**: 
  - Each blue dot on the scatter plot indicates an average share of teleworkable jobs for block groups within a specific density percentile.
- **Trend**:
  - There is a general upward trend in the share of teleworkable jobs as population density increases.
  - The increase is more pronounced at the very high density percentiles (above 90), where the share of teleworkable jobs surpasses 0.4.
  - For lower to mid-density percentiles (below 90), the share of teleworkable jobs seems to plateau around 0.35 to 0.385.

**Note**:
- This analysis only includes block groups in metropolitan areas as identified using the US Census Bureau's Core-Based Statistical Areas.
- Various data sources are referenced for telework potential and employment industry data, including Dingel and Neiman (2020) and the US Census Bureau (2021, 2022).

Summary:
The graph demonstrates that in metropolitan areas, block groups with higher population densities tend to have a higher share of teleworkable jobs, with a notable increase in the highest density percentiles. This indicates a correlation between urban density and the prevalence of jobs that can be performed remotely.
