The graph illustrates the ratio of Social Security Trust Fund reserves to benefits from 1977 to 2057, expressed as a percentage of benefits. 

Key takeaways:
1. **Social Security Old-Age & Survivors Insurance (OASI)**:
   - The reserves peak around 2007 at approximately 360%.
   - The ratio decreases steadily after 2007 and is projected to be exhausted by 2033.

2. **Social Security Disability Insurance (DI)**:
   - Fluctuations were observed from 1977 to 2017, with a significant dip in the early 2020s.
   - After 2027, the reserves start increasing sharply and continue to do so well into 2057, indicating a solvent trajectory.

3. **Combined Trust Funds**:
   - The combined ratio followed trends of OASI closely until 2027.
   - Post-2027, the combined trust funds' reserves decrease and are projected to be depleted by 2035.

Overall, while the Disability Insurance segment is projected to remain solvent and grow, both the Old-Age & Survivors Insurance and the combined trust funds are on a trajectory towards depletion in the coming decades unless interventions are made.
