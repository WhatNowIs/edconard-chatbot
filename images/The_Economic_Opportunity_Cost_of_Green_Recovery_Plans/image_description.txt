The image is a graph illustrating the opportunity costs of vehicle fuel efficiency, specifically representing the relationship between marginal cost ($/MPG/Vehicle) and MPG standard. 

Key points summarized:

1. **Vertical Axis:** Represents the cost per mile per gallon (MPG) for each vehicle ($/MPG/Vehicle).
   - $18 per MPG for the year 2006 (measured by Anderson & Sallee, 2011).
   - $116 per MPG (measured from GHG trades).
   - $512 per MPG (projected from earlier model years).

2. **Horizontal Axis:** Represents the MPG standard over time.
   - MY2006: The starting MPG standard, denoted by D.
   - MY2012-21 average.
   - MY2035, baseline and Biden plan: Future MPG standards with associated costs and planned improvements.

3. **Red Line:** Represents the marginal cost of tightening the fuel efficiency standard across different vehicle model years.

4. **Key Points on the Graph:**
   - MY2006 is associated with the low marginal cost of $18 per MPG as measured by Anderson & Sallee (2011).
   - Moving to the right, costs increase with higher MPG standards.
   - The area under the curve (Î”p) between the MY2035 baseline and the MY2035 Biden plan represents the impact on the quality-adjusted price per vehicle.

5. **Marginal Cost of Tightening Standard:** Illustrates that as MPG standards become stricter from MY2006 to MY2035 according to the Biden plan, the associated marginal costs increase significantly.

6. **Sources:** Data and interpretation are provided by Mulligan (2020) and Anderson & Sallee (2011). It is noted that $116/MPG/Vehicle is equivalent to $86 per ton of Greenhouse Gas (GHG).

By presenting the costs associated with increasing vehicle fuel efficiency standards, the graph underscores the trade-offs involved in improving fuel efficiency over time. The marginal cost rises as standards become stricter, suggesting higher economic impacts per quality-adjusted vehicle price.
