The chart in Figure 2 illustrates the Federal primary deficit and its components from 2003 to 2023, with projections by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) starting in 2024.

Key Points:
1. **Components of the Primary Deficit**:
   - **Structural Component** (Yellow): This remains relatively stable throughout the period, showing a slight downward trend in recent years.
   - **Normal Cyclical Component** (Green): Generally fluctuates minimally but increases during economic downturns (e.g., around 2008 and 2020).
   - **Excess Cyclical Component** (Blue): Exhibits significant peaks during major economic crises such as the financial crisis (2008) and the COVID-19 pandemic (2020).

2. **Total Primary Deficit** (Black Line):
   - **2003-2007**: Shows a slight primary surplus.
   - **2008-2013**: Large jump in deficit reaching its peak during the financial crisis period (2008-2010).
   - **2014-2019**: Fluctuates slightly around zero.
   - **2020-2023**: Another sharp increase in the deficit during the COVID-19 pandemic before starting to taper off in 2023 with projections suggesting a continued climb.

3. **CBO Projections (Post-2023)**:
   - The chart includes a projected trend line indicating a slight increase in the total primary deficit.

4. **Underlying Data Sources**:
   - The data is sourced from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and authors' calculations.

Overall, the primary deficit is driven by structural, normal cyclical, and excess cyclical components, with significant surges during economic crises. The projections by the CBO suggest an ongoing but moderate increase in the deficit in the near future.
