The chart shows the growth trends in net productivity and compensation measures in the U.S. nonfarm business sector from 1929 to 2022. The key metrics tracked in the chart include:

1. **Productivity (blue line)**: This measures the output per hour of labor.
2. **Compensation plus Proprietors' Income per Hour (red line)**: This includes the average compensation received by employees and income received by proprietors per hour of labor.
3. **Median Hourly Compensation (orange line)**: This measures the median compensation earned per hour by workers.
4. **Median Hourly Compensation Counterfactual (dotted line)**: This line represents an estimated measure of what the median hourly compensation would be if it had risen in alignment with productivity.

Key observations:

- From 1929 to roughly around 1973, productivity, compensation plus proprietors' income, and median hourly compensation grew closely aligned.
- Post-1973, a significant divergence is observed. Productivity continued to rise sharply, while median hourly compensation increased at a slower rate, indicating a widening gap between productivity and worker compensation.
- The counterfactual median hourly compensation illustrates that had median hourly compensation kept pace with productivity, it would be significantly higher than it currently is.

This divergence suggests that the benefits of increased productivity have not been equally shared with median wage earners, potentially signifying a growing inequality in income distribution within the nonfarm business sector over the past few decades. The trends indicate that productivity has improved substantially more than median compensation, pointing towards structural changes in wage dynamics.
