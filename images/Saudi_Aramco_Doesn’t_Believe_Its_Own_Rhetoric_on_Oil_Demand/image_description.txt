The graph depicts the number of rotary oil and gas rigs operated by Saudi Arabia, the US, and the world from January 2020 to January 2023. The key insights include:

1. **US Rig Count**: The US is now operating almost the same number of oil and gas rigs as it was before the Covid-19 pandemic.
2. **Saudi Arabia Rig Count**: Saudi Arabia's rig count remains at more subdued levels compared to pre-pandemic levels.
3. **Global Trends**: Globally, the rig count is displayed with a rebased index with January 2020 as the base (100). It shows a significant initial decline post-pandemic, followed by a recovery.
4. **Trend Lines**:
   - The US (denoted by the black line) shows a recovery trajectory reaching levels close to 100 by January 2023.
   - Saudi Arabia (denoted by the blue line) had a sharp dip and showed more volatile and subdued recovery, remaining below the 60 mark.
   - The global trend (denoted by the grey line) demonstrates a moderate recovery, running slightly behind the US trend but significantly higher than Saudi Arabia.

The data source is attributed to Baker Hughes and Bloomberg, and the rig counts have been rebased with January 2020's count set to 100 for comparative purposes.
