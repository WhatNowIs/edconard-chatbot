The chart titled "Real Employment Cost Index, Wages and Salaries for All Private Workers" illustrates the changes in wages and salaries relative to a baseline index of December 2019 (=100). The graph compares the actual wage index to a pre-pandemic trend trajectory from late 2019 to early 2023. Key points from the chart are:

1. **Pre-pandemic Trend**: The dotted orange line represents the expected trajectory of wages and salaries had the pre-pandemic trend continued uninterrupted.
2. **Actual Wages and Salaries**: The blue solid line shows the real movement of wages and salaries over the period.
3. **Mar-23 Data**: By March 2023, the actual wages and salaries index is 5% below the pre-pandemic trend, indicating a notable decline compared to expected growth if the pandemic had not occurred.
4. **Trend Analysis**: After initially matching the pre-pandemic trend up until around 2020, the actual index fluctuates and significantly deviates from the trend starting in early 2021, showing a downward pattern through late 2022, with a slight recovery trend beginning early 2023.

**Source Information**: The data is sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with the graph utilizing calculations by the authors via Macrobond. The pre-pandemic trend is based on log-linear regression from March 2018 to December 2019, adjusted by the consumer price index for urban consumers.

In summary, the chart highlights the impact of the pandemic on wages and salaries, illustrating a marked decrease in the actual growth rate compared to the expected pre-pandemic trend, with a recovery beginning but actual figures remaining below the trend line as of March 2023.
