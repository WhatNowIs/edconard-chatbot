The chart titled "Annual installations of industrial robots in 2022" displays data on the number of industrial robot installations across various countries, measured in thousands of units. The key points are summarized as follows:

- **China:** Dominates with the highest number of installations, just under 250,000 units.
- **Japan:** In second place, with approximately 50,000 units.
- **United States:** Third, with slightly fewer than Japan.
- **South Korea:** Next, with installations between 30,000 and 40,000 units.
- **Germany:** Follows closely behind South Korea.
- **Other notable countries:** 
  - Italy, Taiwan, France, and Mexico each have installations ranging between 10,000 and 20,000 units.
  - Singapore, India, Spain, Turkey, Thailand, and Canada have installations below 10,000 units each.

China leads by a substantial margin, with a significant gap between it and other countries. The data reflects the focus and investment in automation technologies in various industrialized nations.
