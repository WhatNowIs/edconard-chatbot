The image illustrates the increasing role of new space companies in fueling space-related R&D spending over the years, depicted in a line graph showing expenditures from 2010 to 2020. Key points include:

1. Space-related R&D expenditures have significantly increased from around $10 billion in 2010 to nearly $30 billion in 2020.
2. The contributions towards R&D spending come from three main sources:
   - New space companies (in light blue), categorized as those founded since 2000 and assumed to be dedicating a significant portion of their funding towards R&D, show substantial growth.
   - Traditional aerospace and defense companies (in medium blue) also contribute but to a lesser extent.
   - The US government (in dark blue) consistently contributes a foundational amount, although its relative proportion decreases as private sector spending rises.
3. The image is sourced from McKinsey & Company, combining company financial statements, Crunchbase data, expert interviews, and McKinsey's Corporate Performance Analytics.

In summary, the graph indicates a shift in space-related R&D expenditure dynamics, with new space companies emerging as pivotal players alongside traditional entities and government funding.
