The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between the growth rate of productivity (on the y-axis) and the growth rate of the working-age population as a share of total population (on the x-axis). 

Here are the key points:

1. **Axial Labels**: 
   - The y-axis represents the growth rate of productivity. 
   - The x-axis represents the growth rate of the working-age population as a share of the total population.

2. **Data Points**:
   - The scatter plot includes various data points represented by blue dots. Each dot corresponds to a particular instance connecting the two variables.

3. **General Trend**:
   - The plotted points suggest a negative correlation between the two variables.
   - As the growth rate of the working-age population increases, the growth rate of productivity tends to decrease, which is highlighted by the downward-sloping regression line fitting the data points.

4. **Notable Point**:
   - The plot highlights "1980s Spain" at a point where the productivity growth rate is about 0.02 and the working-age population growth rate is about -0.03, signifying a specific historical example within the data.

Overall, the scatter plot depicts a general trend where an increase in the growth rate of the working-age population as a share of the total population correlates with a decrease in the growth rate of productivity.
