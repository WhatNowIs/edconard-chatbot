The graph illustrates the stock of excess savings as a percentage of GDP across several advanced economies from the third quarter of 2019 (Q3 2019) to the first quarter of 2023 (Q1 2023). The countries included are Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Key points:
1. **Trends Over Time**:
   - There is a significant increase in excess savings across all countries starting in early 2020, corresponding to the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - This increase peaks around the first and second quarters of 2021.
   - Following the peak, the excess savings start declining for most countries, with varying rates of decrease among them.

2. **Country Comparisons**:
   - The United States shows the most significant fluctuation, reaching its peak just below 14% of GDP around Q1 2021, and then experiencing a sharp decline, dropping below 0% by Q1 2023.
   - Australia peaks the highest among the remaining countries, exceeding 10% of GDP before gradually declining.
   - The other countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) display relatively similar patterns with peaks around 6-8% of GDP and gradual declines after 2021.

3. **By Q1 2023**:
   - By Q1 2023, most countries have reverted to pre-pandemic levels of excess savings or slightly above it.
   - The United States notably drops below 0%, indicating possibly lower savings than pre-pandemic levels.

This graph highlights the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on savings behavior across several advanced economies, showing a temporary spike in excess savings followed by a gradual normalization or reduction below pre-pandemic levels.
