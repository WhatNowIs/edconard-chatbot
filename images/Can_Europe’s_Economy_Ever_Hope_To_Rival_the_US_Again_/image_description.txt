This image from the Financial Times demonstrates the relationship between investment rates and productivity growth in the US and selected European economies over time. 

**Key insights:**

1. **Net Investment Rate (% of GDP):**
   - The US generally maintained a higher net investment rate compared to Europe from 1995 to 2019.
   - Both regions experienced fluctuations, with significant dips around the time of the 2008 financial crisis. However, the US showed a recovery in investment rates while the average for Europe did not rebound as strongly.

2. **Change in Total Factor Productivity (TFP):**
   - Productivity growth (indexed at 100 in 1995) shows a more substantial increase for the US, especially after 2010.
   - European countries (France, Germany, UK) show slower and more stagnant growth in Total Factor Productivity. Germany experienced a sharp decline around 2010, but overall, none of these countries matched the productivity gains seen in the US.

**Conclusion:**
The data suggests a positive correlation between higher investment rates and higher productivity growth. The US, with its higher investment rate post-2008 crisis, achieved a significant increase in productivity compared to Europe. This indicates the potential importance of investment in driving productivity improvements.
