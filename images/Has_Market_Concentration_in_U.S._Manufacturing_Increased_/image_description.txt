Key points include:
1. **Production Concentration**: Represented by the blue line, this has been steadily increasing from slightly above 0.6 in 1992 to nearly 0.67 by 2012.
2. **Market Concentration**: Represented by the red line, this remains relatively stable, hovering around 0.54 throughout the same period.
