The graph titled "Reversing Hysteresis" presents data on Real Personal Consumption Expenditures Per Capita for Durable Goods in the United States, expressed in billions of 2012 dollars. The analysis compares actual expenditures with two trends: the Pre-Great Recession Trend and the Pre-COVID Trend.

Key observations:

1. **Trends**:
   - **Pre-Great Recession Trend** (dashed teal line): This trend shows the projected growth in expenditures if the Great Recession had not occurred.
   - **Pre-COVID Trend** (dashed red line): This trend reflects the projected growth trajectory before the COVID-19 pandemic.

2. **Real Expenditures**:
   - The actual expenditures (solid yellow line) closely followed the Pre-Great Recession Trend until the economic downturn around 2008.
   - Post-recession, expenditures grew more slowly but started to recover, tracking below the Pre-Great Recession Trend.
   - Around 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, expenditures spiked significantly, surpassing both the Pre-Great Recession and Pre-COVID Trends.

3. **Current Position**:
   - Post-2020, real personal consumption expenditures per capita on durable goods are above the Pre-COVID Trend and close to the Pre-Great Recession Trend, indicating a robust recovery and growth in durable goods consumption.

This graph indicates a strong recovery in durable goods consumption post-COVID, reversing the slowed growth experienced post-Great Recession.
