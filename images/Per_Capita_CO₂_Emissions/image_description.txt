The graph presents per capita CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry in the United States, China, and the European Union (28 countries) from 1750 to 2021. Key points include:

1. **United States**:
   - Per capita CO2 emissions rose significantly after 1900, peaking in the mid-20th century and again in the early 21st century, reaching above 20 metric tons per person.
   - More recently, emissions have shown a noticeable decline, dropping below 15 tons per capita by 2021.

2. **China**:
   - Per capita CO2 emissions began rising rapidly after 1980, with a significant increase in the early 21st century.
   - Emissions approached around 8 tons per capita by 2021, surpassing the European Unionâ€™s figures.

3. **European Union (28 countries)**:
   - Per capita emissions peaked around 10 tons in the late 20th century.
   - Since then, emissions have gradually decreased, stabilizing around 7 tons per capita by 2021.

4. **General Trends**:
   - The rapid industrialization in China shows a sharp increase in per capita CO2 emissions in recent decades.
   - The United States has historically had the highest per capita emissions but has shown a recent downward trend.
   - The European Union has managed to reduce its emissions after peaking in the mid to late 20th century.

**Source Information**:
- Data sources include Global Carbon Budget (2022), Gapminder (2022), UN (2022), HYDE (2017), and Gapminder (Systema Globalis).
- The data focuses on fossil emissions from industrial processes but excludes changes in land use, deforestation, soils, or vegetation.
