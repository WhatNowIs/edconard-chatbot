1. **Line Graph (Blue Line)**:
   - Real output per hour of all persons was set to 100 in 2017 (base year).
   - There is a continuous upward trend from 2007 to 2023, showing an overall increase in productivity.
   - Significant fluctuations are visible around recession periods (highlighted in light blue).

2. **Bar Chart (Orange Bars)**:
   - Represents quarterly changes (in %) on the right axis.
   - Demonstrates higher volatility during recession periods, particularly in 2008-2009 and 2020.
   - Post-2020, there was a marked increase in output per hour, followed by some fluctuations but maintaining a generally positive trend.

3. **Recessions (Shaded Areas)**:
   - Two recessions are marked: one around the 2008 financial crisis (2008 Q1 - 2009 Q2) and another around the COVID-19 pandemic (2020 Q1 - 2020 Q2).
   - Significant deviations in the productivity trend occur during these periods.

**Summary**:
The nonfarm business sector output per hour has seen a general upward trajectory from 2007 to 2023, demonstrating overall productivity growth. Notable disruptions in this trend coincide with recession periods, particularly during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, both of which caused significant volatility in quarterly changes. Post-2020, the sector saw a sharp increase in productivity that continued on a positive trend despite fluctuations, indicating resilience and recovery.
