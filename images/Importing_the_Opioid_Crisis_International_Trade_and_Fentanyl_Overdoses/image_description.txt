The image presents a series of line graphs and a detailed note explaining the trends in drug overdose rates in U.S. states with above- and below-median drug imports per capita for the years 2008 to 2020. Here is a summary of the charts and the essential points:

### Charts:

1. **Chart A: All Drug Overdoses**
   - The graph shows a notable increase in drug overdose rates for both high importers and low importers of drugs over time.
   - High importers have consistently higher overdose rates, with a sharp rise post-2013, peaking significantly by 2020.

2. **Chart B: Opioid and Non-Opioid Drug Overdoses**
   - The graph breaks down the overdose rates into opioid and non-opioid categories.
   - Overdose rates from opioids are higher among high importers compared to low importers.
   - There is a steep increase in opioid overdoses among high importers post-2013, with non-opioid overdoses remaining lower and more stable over time for both groups.

3. **Chart C: Fentanyl and Non-Fentanyl Opioid Drug Overdoses**
   - This graph focuses on fentanyl-specific overdoses.
   - High importers show a dramatic rise in fentanyl-related overdoses after 2013.
   - Non-fentanyl opioid overdoses have a more gradual increase but remain lower compared to fentanyl overdoses in high-importer states.

### Notes:
 
- These figures display trends for two groups of 25 states each, divided based on median value of imports per resident over the 2008-2020 period.
- Data is derived from ICD-10 coding for drug overdose deaths.
- Opioid and fentanyl-specific codes indicate that the significant increase in drug overdoses post-2013 is mostly due to fentanyl.
- Before 2013, the overdose rates between high and low importers were relatively similar. However, high-importer states exhibit substantially higher overdose rates in subsequent years.

### Conclusion:
The data underscores a crucial trend: following 2013, there is a pronounced increase in overdose rates, particularly fentanyl-related, in states with higher drug imports. This suggests an urgent focus on fentanyl as a key driver in the rising overdose deaths in these regions.
