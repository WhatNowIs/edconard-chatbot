**Summary:**

The image titled "Hitting the Brakes?" displays a chart comparing American companies' net issuance of debt securities and loans versus net value added (blue line) to real nonresidential fixed investment year-over-year (y/y) (red line) from 1952 to 2022. 

**Key Insights:**
1. **Slashing Borrowing:** The text explains that American companies have been reducing their borrowing activities significantly.
2. **Historic Comparison:** Unlike previous periods of economic challenge such as the mid-1970s, early 1980s, early 1990s, early 2000s, and 2008-2010, capital expenditures (capex) and hiring are currently remaining strong despite a reduction in debt growth.
3. **Trends:** The chart reveals fluctuations in both borrowing and investment over the 70-year span. The lines representing net issuance of debt securities and loans and real nonresidential fixed investment often move in sync but show varying degrees and periods of divergence.

**Analysis:** Despite the current halt in debt growth reflected in the chart, companies continue to invest robustly and maintain healthy hiring rates, indicating resilience and stability in the face of reduced borrowing.
