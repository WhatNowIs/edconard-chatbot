The figure titled "Increasing Wage Premium for Education and Cognitive Skill" displays the relationship between age and log wage premium based on three different variables: having a bachelor's degree or more (solid line), a bachelor's degree controlling for the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) score (dashed line), and the AFQT score (dotted line).

Key observations from the graph include:

1. **Wage Premium Growth with Age**:
    - The wage premium for individuals with a bachelor's degree or more increases rapidly between ages 24 and 40, stabilizing somewhat after 40.
    - When the AFQT score is controlled for, the wage premium for having a bachelor's degree still increases with age but at a slightly lower rate than without control.
    - The wage premium associated with the AFQT score also increases with age, but at a significantly lower rate compared to having a bachelor's degree.

2. **Comparative Wage Premiums**:
    - The solid line (bachelor's degree or more) reflects the highest log wage premiums across all age groups.
    - The dashed line (bachelor's degree controlling for AFQT) is consistently lower than the solid line but follows a similar trend.
    - The dotted line (AFQT score) reflects the lowest wage premiums and shows a gradual increase that continues into older age.

3. **Wage Premium Trajectories**:
    - All three curves depict that higher education and cognitive skills positively impact wage premiums over a lifespan, with higher education showing a more substantial impact than cognitive skill alone.

The data is derived from the NLSY79, covering ages 22-60, and suggests that educational attainment and cognitive skills both contribute to wage growth over time, with education having a more pronounced effect. The interaction between age and these factors is controlled for in deriving these results.
