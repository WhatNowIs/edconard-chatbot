The image features two line graphs illustrating the U.S. net foreign asset position and current account from 1990 to 2022, expressed as fractions of U.S. GDP.

1. **Net Foreign Asset Position (Left Graph):**
   - The net foreign asset position showed an overall downward trend from 1990 to 2022.
   - In 1990, the position was around 0.0 (neutral), indicating a balance between assets and liabilities.
   - Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, it progressively declined, indicating an increase in net liabilities relative to GDP.
   - There was a significant dip around the 2008 financial crisis, reaching approximately -0.2 fraction of GDP.
   - Post-crisis, a series of fluctuations were observed, with periods of mild recovery followed by further declines.
   - The position reached its lowest near 2020, around -0.7 fraction of GDP, suggesting considerable growth in net foreign liabilities.

2. **Current Account (Right Graph):**
   - The current account balance continually moved further into the negative zone from 1990 to 2022.
   - In the early 1990s, it hovered around -0.01 fraction of GDP.
   - The 2000s saw a sharper decline, with the current account balance falling to roughly -0.06 fraction of GDP by mid-decade.
   - There were periods of partial recovery post-2008, indicated by temporary increases towards neutrality.
   - However, the general trend remained negative, with repeated dips, especially around economic downturns.
   - By 2022, the current account was slightly improving but still significantly negative, closer to -0.04 fraction of GDP.

**Summary:**
From 1990 to 2022, both the U.S. net foreign asset position and current account exhibited marked deteriorations, reflecting an increasing accumulation of foreign liabilities, especially stark during economic crises like the 2008 financial downturn. While there were instances of recovery, the overall trend for both metrics indicates growing economic imbalances vis-Ã -vis foreign assets and transactions.
