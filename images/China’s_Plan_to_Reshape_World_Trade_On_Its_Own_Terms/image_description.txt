This image illustrates a comparison of Chinese exports to Southeast Asia (Asean countries) and the United States over the period from 2000 to 2023. The data, presented in billions of dollars, is the sum of exports over the previous 12 months.

Key points to take from this chart are:

1. **Growth Trend**: Both export lines show a general upward trend over the period, with notable fluctuations.
   
2. **Cross-over Point**: Around the year 2020, Chinese exports to Southeast Asia (represented in blue) surpassed Chinese exports to the US (represented in pink). This is significant as it marks a shift in trade focus towards the ASEAN countries.

3. **Recent Declines**: While both exports saw peaks, there is a visible decline in the latter part of the graph, indicating a reduction in exports to both regions in recent months.

4. **Quantitative Details**: By the final data point in 2023, exports to Southeast Asia are around $600 billion, whereas exports to the US are slightly below $600 billion but still substantial.
