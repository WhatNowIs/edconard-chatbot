The bar chart illustrates changes in population growth across seven swing states (Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona) since the 2020 election. It specifically compares projected population growth in counties that voted for Trump (represented by red bars) versus those that voted for Biden (represented by blue bars).

Here are the key takeaways:
1. **Wisconsin**: Minimal net growth in both Trump-voting and Biden-voting counties, with a slight edge for Biden-voting counties.
2. **Michigan**: Low net growth, with Biden counties seeing slightly higher growth than Trump counties.
3. **Pennsylvania**: Negligible population difference, with Biden-voting areas showing minor growth and Trump-voting areas showing virtually none.
4. **Nevada**: Moderate growth in Biden-voting counties, while Trump-voting counties have minimal growth.
5. **Georgia**: Significant growth in both, with Trump-voting counties showing higher growth than Biden-voting ones.
6. **North Carolina**: Notable growth in both types of counties, with Biden-voting counties having higher growth.
7. **Arizona**: Very high net growth especially in Biden-voting counties, surpassing 400,000, while Trump-voting counties show substantial but markedly less growth.

The sources for the data include the US Census, state government projections, and The Associated Press. The note mentions that growth estimates vary by state, ranging from 2020-2023 to 2020-2025, depending on the state.
