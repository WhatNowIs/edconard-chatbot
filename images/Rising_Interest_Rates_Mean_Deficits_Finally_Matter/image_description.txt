This chart displays the 12-month total federal deficit as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) from around 2015 to early 2023, sourced from Suttle Economics. Key observations include:

1. **Trend from 2015 to 2019**: The federal deficit as a share of GDP ranged between -2.5% to about -5%, showing a relatively stable but gently declining trend.

2. **Sharp Decline in 2020**: There is a prominent and rapid decline starting in early 2020, with the deficit hitting its peak low at around -22.5%. This substantial increase is likely associated with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and extensive government spending initiatives during that period.

3. **Recovery Post-2020**: Following the steep drop, there is a noticeable recovery where the deficit rate starts decreasing significantly by mid-2020, ultimately moving towards a less severe deficit.

4. **Recent Trends**: From late 2021 onwards, the deficit stabilizes, with fluctuations ranging between -7.5% and -10% of GDP.

In summary, the federal deficit as a share of GDP experienced a dramatic spike in 2020, likely due to the pandemic, before gradually recovering. The chart highlights the significant fiscal impact of the pandemic and subsequent adjustments over time.
