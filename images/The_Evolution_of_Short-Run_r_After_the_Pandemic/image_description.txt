The image depicts a graph titled "Change in r* and Its Drivers according to the Model" with percent, annualized on the y-axis ranging from -2 to 3, and years from 2021 to 2025 on the x-axis. The graph features several bar and line plots representing various factors driving the change in r*, or the natural rate of interest. 

### Summary

1. **Key Variables and Colors:**
   - **Government (Blue)**
   - **Financial (Brown)**
   - **TFP - Total Factor Productivity (Dark Grey)**
   - **Mark-up (Light Grey)**
   - **Policy (Dark Blue)**
   - **MEI (Mint)** 
   - **Covid-19 (Grey)**
   - **Measurement (Green)**
   - **Other (Teal)**
   - **Historical Difference (Black Line)**
   - **Forecast Difference (Red Line)**

2. **Graph Insights:**
   - Early in 2021, the influence of Covid-19 (grey) negatively impacted r*, pushing it down close to -1.5%.
   - Financial factors (brown) consistently had a significant positive influence on r* across all observed years.
   - Other factors (teal) and MEI (mint) had minor contributions throughout 2021 to 2025.
   - The historical difference (black line) shows a sharp increase in 2022, peaking around 1.5%, then gradually declines and stabilizes by 2023.
   - The forecast difference (red line) continues upwards after 2022, peaking in 2023, then declining slowly until 2025.

3. **Trends Over Time:**
   - There's considerable initial volatility in r* from 2021 to early 2023 driven by the cumulative effects of various factors.
   - After 2023, changes in r* become more stable and gradually decrease.

4. **Impact of Covid-19:**
   - The direct impact of Covid-19 is prominent in 2021, declining as a factor in subsequent years.

5. **Overall r* Movement:**
   - The trend shows that r* initially dips below zero, then recovers and peaks around 2022-2023, before gradually declining toward 2025.
