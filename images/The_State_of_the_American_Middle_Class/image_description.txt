The image is a bar chart from the Pew Research Center showing the growth in median household incomes for three income tiers in the U.S. (upper, middle, and lower) from 1970 to 2022, adjusted to 2023 dollars and scaled to a three-person household.

Key points:
1. **Upper-Income Households**:
   - 2022 Median Income: $256,920
   - 1970 Median Income: $144,068
   - Percentage Increase: 78%
   
2. **Middle-Income Households**:
   - 2022 Median Income: $106,092
   - 1970 Median Income: $66,417
   - Percentage Increase: 60%

3. **Lower-Income Households**:
   - 2022 Median Income: $35,318
   - 1970 Median Income: $22,831

The chart illustrates that upper-income households have experienced the most significant increase in median income over the past five decades (78% increase). Middle-income households saw a 60% increase, while lower-income households had the smallest growth at 55%. 

The data was analyzed based on incomes assigned to the respective tiers for each surveyed year, adjusted for household size, and sourced from the Pew Research Center's analysis of the Current Population Survey and other relevant data sets from 1971 and 2023.
