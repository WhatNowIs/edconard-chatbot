The image is a line graph titled "Exhibit 5: US Growth Outperformance Has Likely Peaked." It compares the two-quarter annualized real GDP growth between the US and the rest of the G10 countries from Q3 2022 to Q4 2024. The key points are as follows:

- The y-axis represents the percentage change in two-quarter annualized real GDP growth.
- The x-axis shows the timeline from Q3 2022 to Q4 2024.
- The dark blue solid line represents the US GDP growth, while the red solid line represents the GDP growth of the rest of the G10 countries.
- Starting in Q3 2022, the US GDP growth was slightly below that of the rest of the G10 countries.
- The US GDP growth significantly increased in Q4 2022, peaking in Q3 2023, and then starts to decline.
- The GDP growth for the rest of the G10 countries experienced a decline from Q3 2022 to Q4 2022, followed by a steady recovery through 2023 and 2024.
- The projected forecasts, represented by dashed lines, indicate that US GDP growth and G10 GDP growth will continue to stabilize but remain lower than the peak observed in Q3 2023 for the US.
- By the end of the forecast period in Q4 2024, both the US and G10 GDP growth rates are expected to be closer but still divergent.

Summary: The graph underscores the past and projected future trends in GDP growth for the US and other G10 countries. It highlights that the US had a peak in GDP growth in Q3 2023, whereas the rest of the G10 countries are recovering but at a steadier pace. US growth outperformance is expected to taper off, leading to a more balanced growth rate among the G10 countries by the end of 2024.
