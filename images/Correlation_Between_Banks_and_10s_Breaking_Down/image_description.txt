The image illustrates a graph featuring the divergence between the 10-year yield and bank stocks, captured by evaluating the 10-year rates (left scale) against the KBW Bank Index divided by the S&P 500 (right scale), over a timeline from June 2010 to March 2023. 

**Key Observations:**
- **Overall Trends**:
  - Initially, from 2010 to approximately 2015, the 10-year rates and the bank stock index followed a similar trend, albeit with some fluctuations.
  - From around 2016, deviations start becoming more noticeable, with the disparity becoming significantly clear from 2019 onwards.

- **Significant Time Intervals**:
  - **2015-2016**: Both indexes experienced a noticeable decline.
  - **2017-2019**: There was a general upward trend with increased volatility, followed by a sharp dip in early 2020, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
  - **Post-2020**: Initially, both indices improved but there was a divergence starting in 2021.
  
- **Recent Developments (from 2021 to 2023)**:
  - The graph marks the commencement of Federal Reserve hikes, illustrating a significant increase in the 10-year rates (green line), reaching around 4.5% by mid-2022 before experiencing minor drops.
  - Concurrently, the KBW Bank Index divided by the S&P 500 (blue line) starts to decline from early 2022 onwards, reaching its lowest point since the beginning of the timeline by 2023.

**Conclusion**:
While there was a relatively aligned movement between 10-year yields and bank stocks from 2010 to 2019, post-2019, especially visible post-2021 during the Fed rate hikes, a marked divergence has emerged. The 10-year rates have risen while bank stocks, relative to the S&P 500, have notably declined.
