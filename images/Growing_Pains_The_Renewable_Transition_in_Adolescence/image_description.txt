The chart presents information about California's Effective Load Carrying Capability (ELCC) for renewable energy, specifically wind, solar, and storage solutions. Here is a summary based on the data provided:

1. **Total Renewable Capacity**: California has a significant renewable capacity of 245 GW derived from wind, solar, and storage.
   
2. **Composition of Renewable Capacity**:
   - Solar contributes roughly 152 GW.
   - Wind accounts for about 21 GW.
   - 6-hour storage provides around 49 GW.
   - Additional diversity benefits add up to the total renewable capacity.

3. **Effective Load Carrying Capacity (ELCC)**: Despite the high total renewable capacity, these resources only yield 50 GW of effective load carrying capacity.
   
4. **Breakdown of ELCC**:
   - ELCC highlights the actual dependable load carrying capability contributed by the combined renewable sources.
   - The components (Solar, Wind, 6-hr storage, and Diversity benefit) contribute to this capacity, but even combined, they capture significantly less than their total installed capacity. 

This chart emphasizes the difference between installed renewable capacity and the effective load carrying capacity, showcasing the challenges in relying on renewable energy sources solely for peak load capacity.
