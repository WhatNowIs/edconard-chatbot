The image provides a detailed visualization of the changes in the US natural rate of interest since 1970, broken down by various contributing factors in percentage points. Below is a summary based on the data presented:

### Key Points:

1. **Overall Trend**:
   - The natural rate of interest in the US has been on a downward trend since 1970.
   - The rate, which was positive in the early 1970s, declined significantly and turned negative in recent decades.

2. **Growth**:
   - There has been a gradual decline in the contribution of growth to the natural rate of interest, shifting from mildly positive to slightly negative by 2022.

3. **Inflation Risk**:
   - The contribution of inflation risk to the natural rate of interest has been volatile. While initially contributing positively, it has significantly declined, contributing negatively in the recent years.

4. **Investment Prices**:
   - The influence of investment prices on the natural rate of interest has shown a moderate downward trend, contributing negatively over the years.

5. **Inequality**:
   - Inequality has increasingly contributed negatively to the natural rate of interest, becoming a significant factor over time.

6. **US Debt**:
   - The influence of US debt on the natural rate of interest started as a minor factor but has grown more pronouncedly negative over time.

7. **Population Aging**:
   - Population aging emerged as a notable negative factor from the mid-1980s and has grown over time.

8. **Global Spillovers and Other**:
   - This category shows a mixed but overall negative impact, becoming more considerable in its negative contribution in recent years.

### Summary:

The natural rate of interest in the US has been declining since 1970, with multiple factors contributing to this trend. Economic growth, which once buoyed the rate, now contributes negatively. Inflation risk initially was a major positive factor but has turned negative. Investment prices, inequality, and US debt have increasingly exerted downward pressure on the rate. Population aging has also become a significant negative contributor in recent decades. Lastly, global spillovers and other factors have added to the downward trend, particularly since the late 1980s. This confluence of factors results in a natural rate of interest that has shifted from positive to negative over the past five decades.
