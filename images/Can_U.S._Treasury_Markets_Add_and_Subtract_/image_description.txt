This figure illustrates two separate graphs depicting the cumulative change in Treasury values over three distinct sets of days from January 2000 to December 2022.

- The top panel represents days of large negative proposals.
  - The light gray line represents the cumulative change across all trading days.
  - The red line focuses on the cumulative change on days with large negative proposals that do not coincide with FOMC meeting days.
  - The dark gray line indicates the cumulative change on all other trading days.
  
  Over time, the cumulative change on large negative proposal days (red line) has consistently declined, reaching a significant negative cumulative change by 2022, indicating substantial negative impact.

- The bottom panel illustrates days of large positive proposals.
  - Similar to the top panel, the light gray line covers the cumulative change across all trading days.
  - The red line highlights days with large positive proposals that do not coincide with FOMC meeting days.
  - The dark gray line presents the cumulative changes on all remaining trading days.
  
  In contrast, the cumulative change on large positive proposal days (red line) has remained relatively stable around zero throughout the period, indicating little to no cumulative impact compared to the other two categories.

The notes clarify that the sample period covers January 2000 to December 2022, and the cumulative changes are segmented by types of proposal days, whether they coincide with FOMC meeting days or not.
