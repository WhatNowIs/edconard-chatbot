This graph, titled "Net Out-Migration Rate by Tax Bracket," illustrates the rates of net out-migration (the difference between out-migration and in-migration) across different tax brackets from the year 2000 to 2020. Each tax bracket is denoted by specific colors and markers. The tax brackets shown include:

- Less than $51,530 (red with square markers)
- 9.3% bracket (green with triangle markers)
- 10.3% bracket (blue with diamond markers)
- 11.3% bracket (purple with circular markers)
- 12.3% bracket under $2 million (yellow with x markers)
- $2-5 million (orange with plus markers)
- Greater than $5 million (maroon with star markers)

Key observations from the graph:
1. **Early 2000s to late 2010s**: There is a general fluctuation in the out-migration rates across all the tax brackets, but these fluctuations are relatively small, generally remaining below 2%.
2. **2011-2013 period**: There is a noticeable spike in out-migration rates, particularly for the higher-income brackets (i.e., 11.3% bracket, 12.3% bracket under $2 million, $2-5 million, and >$5 million).
3. **2014 onwards**: All tax brackets experience variations, with the most significant increase occurring in the highest tax bracket (greater than $5 million), peaking sharply around 2020 at about 4% net out-migration.
4. **General trend**: Higher tax brackets tend to exhibit higher net out-migration rates compared to lower tax brackets.

The note below the graph specifies that the displayed rates are in 2015 dollars, providing a uniform basis for comparison across the years.

In summary, the graph reveals that net out-migration rates tend to be more volatile and elevated for higher income tax brackets over the twenty-year span, with marked peaks during certain periods, most notably around 2011-2013 and a sharp increase around 2020 for the highest income bracket.
