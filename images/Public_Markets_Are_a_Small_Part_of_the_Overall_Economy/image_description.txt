The image is a line graph titled "S&P500 profits make up half of economy-wide corporate profits," showing the relationship between S&P 500 profits and overall US corporate profits. This graph tracks data from March 1998 to March 2023.

Here's a summary of the key points:

- The graph is in billions of dollars ($bn) on the y-axis, with the timeline on the x-axis ranging from March 1998 to March 2023.
- Two lines depict the trends: 
  1. S&P 500 profits (green line, basic earnings)
  2. US corporate profits (dark blue line)
- Both S&P 500 profits and US corporate profits have been steadily increasing over the years, with notable dips during 2001-2003, 2008-2009 (financial crisis), and 2020 (pandemic).
- The S&P 500 profits show a significant and sustained increase from mid-2009 onward, following the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis.
- Around 2020, there's a marked dip in profits for both categories due to the pandemic, followed by a rapid recovery.
- S&P 500 profits have consistently grown in such a way that they now represent approximately half of total US corporate profits.

This visual representation suggests the significant role of S&P 500 companies in the broader landscape of corporate profitability in the United States.
