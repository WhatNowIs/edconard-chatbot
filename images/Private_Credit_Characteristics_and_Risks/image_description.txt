The figure titled "Growth in Private Debt Allocations" illustrates the escalating trend in private debt allocations over time. There are two charts provided:

1. **All Private Debt Strategies**:
   - This chart tracks three variables from 2000 to approximately 2024:
     - **Assets Under Management (AUM)** (solid blue line)
     - **Invested Capital** (dashed brown line)
     - **Dry Powder** (dotted green line)
   - AUM shows a significant increase starting around 2012, accelerating sharply after 2016.
   - Invested Capital followed a similar trajectory with noticeable growth, starting to surge rapidly from around 2016.
   - Dry Powder also increased over time but at a steadier and slower rate compared to AUM and Invested Capital.

2. **Direct Lending**:
   - This chart also follows the same three variables over the same period:
     - **Assets Under Management (AUM)** (solid blue line)
     - **Invested Capital** (dashed brown line)
     - **Dry Powder** (dotted green line)
   - AUM for direct lending shows rapid growth starting from roughly 2016, mirroring the trend seen in the all private debt strategies chart.
   - Invested Capital in direct lending followed a similar accelerating trend from around 2016.
   - Dry Powder increased but at a more moderate pace in comparison to AUM and Invested Capital.

**Key Notes**:
- 'Dry Powder' refers to committed but not yet invested capital.
- Invested Capital is the amount that is both committed and actively invested, typically in the form of loans.
- Assets Under Management (AUM) represents the total of invested capital and dry powder.
- The data is as of June 2023 and is reported with a six-month lag.

In summary, both All Private Debt Strategies and Direct Lending have shown exponential growth in both AUM and Invested Capital from 2012 to 2024, with a significant increase post-2016. Dry Powder grew steadily but at a slower rate.
