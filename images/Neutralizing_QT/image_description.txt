The image is a chart titled "Select Fed Balance Sheet Liabilities ($tln)" with data from January 2022 to October 2023. It features three types of liabilities in different colors:

- **Reserves** (blue)
- **TGA (Treasury General Account)** (orange)
- **Reverse Repo Facilities** (gray)

Key observations:
1. The overall size of the Fed's balance sheet liabilities has been gradually decreasing from January 2022 to October 2023.
2. The reserves, shown in blue, have remained relatively steady during this period.
3. The TGA (orange) and Reverse Repo Facilities (gray) have been shrinking as well, contributing to the overall reduction in liabilities.
4. A notable point is circled in red around October 2023, indicating some specific change or highlight in the TGA portion.

The summary statement below the chart states:
"QT is shrinking the overall size of the Fed balance sheet, but reserve balances remain steady."

This suggests that Quantitative Tightening (QT) is effectively reducing the total liabilities on the Fed's balance sheet, but the reserves' balances have stayed the same over the period.
