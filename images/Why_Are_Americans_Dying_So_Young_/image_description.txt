The provided image presents two charts comparing mortality data for the United States and other peer countries, sourced from the Human Mortality Database and presented by FT. The key observations from the charts are:

1. **Mortality of Five-Year-Olds by Age 40**:
   - The left chart shows that the chance of a five-year-old dying before reaching different ages is significantly higher in the United States compared to peer countries.
   - By the age of 40, approximately 4% of five-year-olds in the US have died, while the percentage is notably lower in peer countries, all of which are clustered closer to 1-2%.

2. **Mortality of 75-Year-Olds Over Time**:
   - The right chart shows the mortality likelihood of a 75-year-old dying before reaching higher ages up to 100.
   - The US and peer countries show similar outcomes in this category, with the chances of dying increasing steadily and converging close to 100% by the age range of 100 years.

**Summary**:
The image illustrates that American children's mortality rates are worse than those of kids in peer countries, with one in 25 (or 4%) of five-year-olds in the US dying before they turn 40. However, for older adults, particularly those aged 75 and above, mortality rates in the US are similar to those in peer nations. This suggests significant issues with child and young adult mortality in the US, despite comparable outcomes later in life. Peer countries in this analysis include Australia, Austria, Canada, England & Wales, France, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland.
