The chart titled "Average Real Wages are Rising" illustrates the trend in real hourly compensation for all workers in the nonfarm business sector over time. The main points are as follows:

1. **Title and Subtitle**: The title emphasizes that average real wages are rising. The subtitle clarifies that while compensation is increasing, it remains below the 2015-2019 trend line.

2. **Timeframe**: The data spans from 2015 to 2023, with the index reference set to Q4 2019 (= 100).

3. **Key Events**:
   - A notable spike in average real wages occurred in 2020.
   - This spike is attributed to the layoffs of low-wage workers during this period and their subsequent rehire, causing wages to fall afterward.

4. **Trend Lines**:
   - **Solid Yellow Line**: This represents the nonfarm business sector's real hourly compensation for all workers.
   - **Dashed Yellow Line**: This indicates the trend growth rate for Q1 2015-Q4 2019.

5. **Data Analysis**:
   - Average real wages experienced a significant spike in 2020 but declined as low-wage workers were rehired.
   - Despite this, there has been a general rise in average real wages, although current levels remain below the pre-2020 trend growth line.

6. **Source and Creator**:
   - The graph was created by @JosephPolitano using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

In summary, the chart highlights that although real hourly compensation for nonfarm business sector workers is on the rise, it hasn't fully recovered to follow the pre-2020 trend growth line after the disruption caused by the pandemic-related layoffs and rehiring.
