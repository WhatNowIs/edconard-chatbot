The infographic details the process of Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) as conducted by the National Ignition Facility in California. The key elements and stages of the process are as follows:

### Key Components:
1. **Hohlraum**: A gold cavity with openings at either end.
2. **Fuel Capsule**: Positioned at the center of the hohlraum.
3. **Deuterium-Tritium Layer**: Found within the fuel capsule.

### How It Works:
1. **Laser Beams and Plasma Generation**:
   - Up to 192 laser beams are fired into the hohlraum.
   - The hohlraum is heated, creating a superhot plasma, a gas stripped of electrons.

2. **X-Ray Impact**:
   - X-rays from the laser-heated hohlraum cause the surface of the fuel capsule to blow off.

3. **Fusion Reaction Initiation**:
   - The fuel layer within the capsule implodes, creating conditions favorable for fusion.
   - If heat spreads rapidly through the fuel, the energy yield can exceed input, achieving ignition.

### Summary:
Inertial Confinement Fusion at the National Ignition Facility involves using an array of lasers to heat a hohlraum, generating plasma. The subsequent X-ray emission causes the capsule's surface to blow off, leading to the implosion of the deuterium-tritium fuel layer. This implosion creates the necessary conditions for nuclear fusion, with the potential to yield more energy than the input, a phenomenon termed as ignition.
