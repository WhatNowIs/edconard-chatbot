The two exhibits from Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research provide insights into recent changes in the financial market.

**Exhibit 1: Contribution to 10-year UST Yield Changes by Macro Factor**
- It illustrates that a significant portion of the recent declines in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields can be attributed to slowing economic growth and policy factors.
- Different factors included in the analysis are Growth, Policy, Inflation, Residual, and the 10-year UST yield.
- The graph shows that both growth and policy factors largely explain the downward trend in yields from October 19 to November 2, 2023.

**Exhibit 2: Cumulative Change in 5-year Swap Spread by Explanatory Variable**
- This exhibit explains the material tightening of the 5-year swap spread since August, mostly attributed to higher funding costs and increased supply.
- Variables included are 2s10s, 3m-ois, Residual, 5y, and log(Debt/GDP).
- The graph shows a cumulative change in the 5-year swap spread from August 2023 projected into December 2024.
- The steepest changes are attributed to factors like 2s10s and 3m-ois, starting in August 2023 and anticipated to continue fluctuating until December 2024.

These exhibits suggest that slowing economic growth and policy changes have influenced the decrease in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields, while increased funding costs and supply adjustments have significantly impacted the 5-year swap spread since August 2023.
