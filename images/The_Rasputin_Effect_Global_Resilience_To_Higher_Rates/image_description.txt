### Overall Summary
The first graph shows a substantial increase in central banks' total assets between 2007 and 2021 due to emergency monetary stimulus measures, with a notable reduction of roughly 35% by 2023 as these measures were being reversed. The second graph highlights the cyclical nature of the US corporate sectorâ€™s financial balance from 1960 to the present, illustrating periods of economic distress where the balance was particularly negative. This information suggests a transitioning phase in post-crisis economic policies and fluctuations in corporate financial health over time.
