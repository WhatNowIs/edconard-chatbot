The image is a line graph titled "US dollar credit outside the United States," analyzing annual changes in percentages from 2005 to 2022. The graph shows the annual growth of US dollar-denominated credit to non-banks outside the US, including total credit, loans, and debt securities. It also details the annual growth of the US dollar nominal effective exchange rate (NEER).

Key points include:
1. The red line represents the annual change in total credit.
2. The blue line shows the annual change in loans.
3. The green line displays the annual change in debt securities.
4. The yellow line indicates the NEER's annual growth.

The data highlights significant fluctuations over the analyzed period. All indicators dipped in 2009, reflecting the global financial crisis. NEER growth shows notable variations, often moving inversely to credit and debt securities until recent years, where trends align more closely. Around 2020, NEER and credit measures show significant movements, likely due to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
