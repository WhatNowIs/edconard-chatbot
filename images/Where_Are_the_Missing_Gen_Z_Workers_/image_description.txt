The chart illustrates changes in the labor force participation rate, seasonally adjusted, from February 2020 to January 2023, segmented by four age groups: 16-19, 20-24, 25-54, and 55+.

Key observations:

1. **16-19 Years Old:** This group (depicted in blue) experienced a significant dip at the onset of the pandemic but saw a strong recovery and steady increase, returning to pre-pandemic levels and slightly surpassing them, showing a positive trend.

2. **20-24 Years Old:** Represented in black, this age group also saw a notable drop at the beginning of the pandemic. However, their recovery was slower and remained consistently below pre-pandemic levels, with minor fluctuations but no significant improvement by January 2023.

3. **25-54 Years Old:** The prime-age working group (depicted in grey) experienced a sharp decline initially but showed a gradual recovery. As of January 2023, their participation rate closely approached the pre-pandemic levels, almost neutral, with slight fluctuations around the baseline.

4. **55+ Years Old:** The senior age group (in red) witnessed a decrease like other groups but has consistently remained below pre-pandemic levels with minimal recovery. Their participation continued to lag behind other age groups throughout the observed period.

The overall summary reflects that while teenagers (16-19) and prime-age workers (25-54) have largely returned to pre-pandemic participation levels, younger adults (20-24) and older workers (55+) are still lagging behind.
