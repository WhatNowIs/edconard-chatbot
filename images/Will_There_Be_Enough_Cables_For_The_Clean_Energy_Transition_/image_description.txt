The image provided is a bar chart from the Financial Times, illustrating the projected demand and estimated supply of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) electricity cables over the period from 2022 to 2031. The data explicitly excludes China.

### Key Points:

1. **Estimated Supply (0,000 km)**:
    - Represented by the pink line.
    - Gradually increases until it plateaus around 2025, staying relatively steady from 2026 to 2031.

2. **Interconnector Demand (0,000 km)**:
    - Represented by green bars.
    - Shows a significant increase from 2022, peaking in 2026 and 2027, followed by a drop in 2028, and then increases again by 2030 and 2031.

3. **Offshore Wind Demand (0,000 km)**:
    - Represented by blue bars.
    - Commences in 2024 and climbs steadily, reaching its height in 2027.
    - Thereafter, it declines in 2028 but shows an upward trend again from 2029 onward.

4. **Total Demand**:
    - Visible as the sum of green and blue bars.
    - Exceeds the estimated supply in the second half of the decade (2026 onward), indicating a projected shortfall of HVDC electricity cables.

### Summary:

The chart highlights a growing demand for HVDC electricity cables, driven by both interconnector and offshore wind demand. This demand is expected to outstrip supply from 2026 onwards, indicating potential shortages and underlining the need for increased production capacity or alternative solutions to meet future energy infrastructure needs.
