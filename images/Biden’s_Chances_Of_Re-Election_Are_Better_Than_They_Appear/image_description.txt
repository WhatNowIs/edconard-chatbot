The image, sourced from "The Economist," presents a scatter plot titled "Goldfish voters" and examines the relationship between changes in real disposable personal income and the incumbent party's popular vote margin in US presidential election years from 1964 to 2016.

Key points include:

1. **Horizontal Axis**: Displays the percentage change in real disposable personal income (annualized for Q3 on Q1) ranging from -4% to 8%.

2. **Vertical Axis**: Shows the incumbent party's popular vote margin compared to the second-placed party, ranging from -20 to 30 percentage points.

3. **Data Points (1964-2016)**: Each dot represents an election year. The colors are coded according to the increase in prices (adjusted by the personal consumption expenditures index), with increments from 4% to 38.9%.

4. **Trend Line**: A positive correlation is visible, suggesting that higher growth in disposable personal income tends to correlate with a higher incumbent party's popular vote margin.

5. **Notable Years**:
   - **1964 and 1972**: High income growth correlates with a substantial incumbent vote margin.
   - **1984 and 1988**: Similar trends but to a lesser extent.
   - **2008**: A significant negative change in disposable income correlates with a large loss in popular vote for the incumbent.

6. **Vision for 2020**: Data for the 2020 election was omitted due to COVID-19 pandemic irregularities.

The image succinctly illustrates how economic conditions, especially changes in disposable personal income, impact the voting outcomes for incumbent parties in US presidential elections over the specified period.
