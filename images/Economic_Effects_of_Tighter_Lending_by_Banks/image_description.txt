The image is a line graph titled "Figure 1: Tightening in commercial and industrial lending standards." It shows the percentage change of lending standards tightening for both small businesses (green line) and medium to large businesses (blue line) from the year 2007 to 2023. 

Key observations:
1. Significant peaks are visible during economic downturns, such as around 2009 and 2020, indicating substantial tightening of lending standards during these periods.
2. The most notable peak occurs around 2009, coinciding with the global financial crisis, with tightening percentages reaching above 80%.
3. Another significant spike is seen around 2020, corresponding with the COVID-19 pandemic, where tightening again surged dramatically.
4. Between these spikes, the tightening standards were below or around the baseline (0%), indicating relative stability or slight easing in lending conditions.
5. The latest data point in 2023 shows a rising trend in the tightening of lending standards for both small and medium to large businesses. 

The source of the data is the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices. 

This graph indicates that banks tend to tighten lending standards significantly during periods of economic uncertainty or crisis, impacting all business sizes, but particularly tightening has been comparatively more consistent for medium to large businesses.
