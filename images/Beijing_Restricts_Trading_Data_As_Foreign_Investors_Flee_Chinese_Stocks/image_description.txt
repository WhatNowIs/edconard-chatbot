The chart compares the performance of the CSI 300, S&P 500, and CNX Nifty indices, rebased in dollar terms, from January to August of an unspecified year. The key takeaway from the chart is that Chinese A-shares (represented by the CSI 300 index) have significantly underperformed compared to global indices such as the S&P 500 and the CNX Nifty.

Here are the main points:
1. **S&P 500 Performance (Red Line)**: The S&P 500 shows consistent upward growth throughout the period, starting at a base value of 100 and rising to above 115 by August.

2. **CNX Nifty Performance (Light Blue Line)**: The CNX Nifty also shows positive performance, although with more volatility compared to the S&P 500. It starts at the base value of 100 and ends higher than the initial value, peaking just below 110.

3. **CSI 300 Performance (Dark Blue Line)**: The CSI 300 underperforms compared to the other two indices. It shows more fluctuation and an overall downward trend, starting at the base value of 100 but dropping below 95 by August.

This indicates that Chinese A-shares have not kept pace with the performance of the US and Indian stock markets over the observed period. The chart is sourced from LSEG via markets.ft.com.
