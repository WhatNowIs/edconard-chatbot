The image is a line graph depicting the three-month annualized change in hourly wages from 2021 to 2023. The graph includes data for three categories:

1. **All Private (Blue Line)**
2. **All Private, Production and Nonsupervisory (Light Blue Line)**
3. **Nonhousing Core Services, Production and Nonsupervisory (Red Line)**

Key observations include:

1. **Initial Trends (Early 2021)**: 
   - All private and all private, production and nonsupervisory categories started around a 4% to 5% increase, sharply declining for all private initially.
   - Nonhousing core services, production and nonsupervisory showed more volatility with higher peaks above 9%.

2. **Mid-2021 to 2022**: 
   - Nonhousing core services (red line) experienced significant fluctuations, peaking around 9% multiple times.
   - The other two categories (blue lines) exhibited moderate fluctuations, generally oscillating between 3% to 7%.

3. **Late 2022 to Early 2023**: 
   - A gradual convergence occurs where all three categories' wage changes align closer, fluctuating around 4% to 5%.

The source of the data is from the White House Council of Economic Advisers for non-housing core services and the Labor Department via the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis for the private and private exclusions of managers.

In summary, the graph highlights varying trends in wage growth across different sectors of the private industry over a span of two years, showing higher volatility in nonhousing core services as compared to other sectors. However, by early 2023, the growth rates across these categories seem to converge towards similar percentages, indicating a stabilization in wage changes.
