The image presents two graphs under the title "Money growth and inflation go hand in hand."

1. **Graph A - Inflation is closely linked to money growth:**
   - The scatter plot shows a strong linear relationship between excess broad money growth (%) and headline inflation (%), using non-overlapping 10-year averages.
   - The regression line equation, indicated by β (slope) of 1.00 with a standard error (S.E.) of 0.036, suggests a direct correlation where a 1% increase in money growth corresponds to a 1% increase in inflation.
   - The R² value of 0.98 indicates that 98% of the variability in headline inflation can be explained by broad money growth, confirming a very strong statistical relationship.

2. **Graph B - ...but only in countries and in times of high inflation:**
   - This line graph shows the slope coefficient, β, as a function of different inflation thresholds, plotting estimates and their respective 95% confidence intervals.
   - The estimate (solid green line) and its confidence interval (dashed green lines) for low inflation regimes (left side of the graph) indicate weaker correlation.
   - As the inflation threshold increases (right side of the graph), the estimate and 95% confidence interval for high inflation regimes (solid and dashed red lines) show a stronger and consistent coefficient around 1.0.
   - This suggests that the strong link between money growth and inflation is mostly present in countries or periods with higher inflation rates.

### Summary:
The presented graphs effectively highlight the relationship between money growth and inflation. Graph A demonstrates a strong, direct linear correlation with statistical robustness, implying that increases in money growth significantly drive inflation over time. Graph B further nuances this relationship by indicating that the strong linkage is predominantly valid in high-inflation contexts, whereas in low-inflation regimes, this relationship is considerably weaker.
