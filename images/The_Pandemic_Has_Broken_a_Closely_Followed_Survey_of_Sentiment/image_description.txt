The image illustrates an "Index of Consumer Sentiment" in the United States. It compares the actual consumer sentiment derived from surveys (light blue line) with expected sentiment based on economic data from 1980-2016 (dark blue line). 

Key points include:
- Before the pandemic, consumer sentiment closely matched the real economy.
- Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans have exhibited a notably gloomy outlook despite a robust economy.
- This gloominess led to consumer sentiment reaching its lowest recorded value during the pandemic.
- The graph encompasses data from 1990 to the present, marking periods of recession, including the COVID-19 recession.
- The general pattern shows that consumer sentiment tends to oscillate, reflecting economic conditions and major events.

The graph offers insights into the psychological and behavioral aspects of consumer economics in relation to actual economic conditions over time.
