The image is a line graph showing the year-over-year percentage change (%YoY) in real GDP components for both cyclical and non-cyclical sectors from December 2021 to September 2023. Key points include:

1. **Cyclical Components:**
   - Showed a decline from above 2% in December 2021 into negative territory by June 2022.
   - Experienced a brief rebound around September 2022 before declining again by December 2022.
   - Began a substantial recovery post-March 2023, coinciding with easing financial conditions after the Federal Reserve's (Fed) pivot and interventions following SVB (Silicon Valley Bank) events.
   - Continued to improve steadily up to September 2023.

2. **Non-Cyclical Components:**
   - Maintained a gradual decline from nearly 8% in December 2021 to about 4% in September 2023.
   - The rate of decline appears more gradual and consistent relative to the cyclical components.

3. **Key Annotations:**
   - Financial conditions tightened as the Fed started raising rates around March 2022.
   - Financial conditions began to ease following pivotal events involving the Federal Reserve and SVB beginning from March 2023, aiding the recovery of cyclical components.

4. **Interpreting the Data:**
   - Easier financial conditions in 2023 contributed to the rebound in the cyclical components of GDP, whereas non-cyclical components depicted a slower and more stable adjustment.

The analysis suggests that easier financial conditions, particularly following significant fiscal interventions and policy adjustments, have positively influenced the recovery of the cyclical components of GDP.
