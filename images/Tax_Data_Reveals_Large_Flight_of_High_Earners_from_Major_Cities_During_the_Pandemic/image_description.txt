The chart illustrates the annual change in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) from net migration across different county types in the U.S. from 2012 to 2021. The county types include nonmetro rural, metro rural, exurban, suburban, small urban, and large urban areas.

Key observations include:

1. **Large Urban Counties**: Experienced a significant decline in AGI from net migration, starting with a steady drop from 2012, deepening sharply from around 2019, and hitting the lowest point in 2021 at approximately -$60 billion.

2. **Nonmetro Rural, Metro Rural, Exurban, Suburban, and Small Urban Counties**: Generally show positive trends in AGI changes over the years. These county types maintained relatively stable AGI levels with slight fluctuations, especially from 2016 onwards.

3. **Peak and Trough Patterns**: While large urban areas saw a dramatic downward trend, other county types experienced gradual increases or stable trends with slight variances. Exurban and suburban areas, in particular, have shown the most consistent positive changes in recent years, particularly noticeable around 2020-2021.

This data suggests a migration trend favoring non-large urban areas, potentially driven by various socioeconomic factors. The source of the data is the Economic Innovation Group (EIG) analysis based on IRS data, highlighting shifts in demographic and economic patterns.
