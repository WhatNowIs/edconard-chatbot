The graph displays the trends in four indices related to substance use, normalized to a baseline value of 100 in 2008, over the years 1975 to 2025. These indices are:

- The prevalence of daily and near-daily use (red diamonds)
- Days of use per capita (yellow triangles)
- Past-month prevalence (blue squares)
- Past-year prevalence (green circles)

Key takeaways from the graph:

1. **Normalization and Survey Redesigns:**
   - All per capita rates are normalized to a value of 100 in 2008.
   - There are two major survey redesigns indicated by dashed vertical lines, occurring around the years 1990 and 2000.

2. **Trends Over Time:**
   - There is a general decline in all metrics from 1980 to the early 1990s.
   - Between 1995 and 2005, all metrics remain relatively steady.
   - Post-2005, there is a noticeable upward trend in all indices, with a significant acceleration starting around 2010.

3. **Recent Trends:**
   - From 2010 onward, all metrics show a sharp increase. The prevalence of daily and near-daily use (red diamonds) exhibits the steepest rise, surpassing 300 by 2025.
   - Days of use per capita (yellow triangles) and past-month prevalence (blue squares) also show considerable increases, approaching around 300.
   - The past-year prevalence (green circles) increases as well, but at a slightly slower rate compared to other indices.

In summary, the chart highlights a significant rise in substance use metrics from approximately 2010 onwards, following a period of relatively stable usage from the mid-1990s to 2005.
