The image presents a bar chart titled "The Saudis Don't Have Petrodollars," highlighting the trend in Saudi Arabia's current account surplus as a percentage of GDP from 1975 to 2025. Key points include:

1. **Peak in 1974:** Saudi Arabiaâ€™s current account surplus reached an all-time high of more than 50% of its GDP in 1974, coinciding with the birth of the petrodollar.
2. **Decline Over Time:** Since 1974, the surplus has significantly declined, showing considerable fluctuation in subsequent years.
3. **Periods of Deficit:** Notable periods of deficits occur in the mid-1980s and early 1990s.
4. **Surpluses and Deficits:** There were rises in the surplus during early 2000s and mid-2000s, followed by fluctuating patterns in the 2010s.
5. **Recent Years and Forecast:** From 2020 onwards, the bar chart indicates fluctuating but smaller surpluses and projects near zero or slight deficits up to 2025.

The data suggest a significant decrease in the role and impact of petrodollars on Saudi Arabia's economy over the years, from the height of dominance in the mid-1970s to a more balanced and less surplus-driven account in recent and forecasted years. The sources of the data are the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
