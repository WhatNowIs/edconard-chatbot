The image provides a map illustrating the locations of select announced electric vehicle (EV) battery and assembly plants across the United States. The map highlights the expected new jobs that these plants will create, with different sized circles indicating employment estimates. Here are the key points from the image:

1. **Geographical Distribution**:
   - The concentration of new facilities is particularly notable in the Midwest and Southern regions of the U.S.
   - States with significant activity include Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Georgia, and Tennessee.
   - There is also relevant activity in other states like North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Kansas, and Arizona.

2. **Expected New Jobs**:
   - Plants vary widely in the number of new jobs they are expected to create, with some plants projected to create as many as 5,000 jobs.
   - The largest circles, signifying the highest number of jobs, are concentrated in states like Georgia, Tennessee, and Michigan, indicating substantial employment opportunities in these regions.

3. **Employment Estimates**:
   - These estimates are based on company reports and may vary, as some project specifics were unavailable.
   - Some locations may represent a combination of multiple battery plants.

4. **Source and Terminology**:
   - The information is sourced from company reports and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's NAATBatt Lithium-Ion Battery Supply Chain database.
   - The map is primarily used to illustrate job creation potential in the booming EV battery and assembly plant sector in the U.S.

In summary, the map highlights the emerging hotspots for EV battery and assembly plant development, mainly in the Midwest and Southern regions, with significant job creation potential as indicated by the size of circles representing expected new jobs. These developments align with the growing focus on EV technologies and infrastructure in the U.S.
