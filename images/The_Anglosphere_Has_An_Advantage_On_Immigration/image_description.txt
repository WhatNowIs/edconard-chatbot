The image presents a comparison of the total fiscal ratio of foreign-born people in various Anglophone and European countries over the period from 2006 to 2018. 

**Key Insights:**

1. **Anglophone Countries:**
   - **Australia, Ireland, UK, and US** show a positive fiscal contribution from immigrants. In these countries, the total fiscal ratio of foreign-born people is above 1, indicating that immigrants contribute more in taxes than they receive in government spending.
   - Specifically:
     - **Australia** maintains a steady positive contribution.
     - **Ireland** shows a significant positive contribution since around 2012 after an initial dip.
     - **UK** has fluctuations but trends towards positive, particularly noticeable around 2018.
     - **US** started below 1 but rises to a positive contribution by 2018.

2. **European Countries:**
   - **Belgium, France, Netherlands, and Sweden** reflect a net fiscal recipient scenario where the total fiscal ratio is below 1. This means that immigrants in these countries tend to receive more in government spending than they contribute in taxes.
   - Specifically:
     - **Belgium** consistently shows a fiscal ratio below 1, though it slightly improves over time.
     - **France** remains below 1, without significant improvements.
     - **Netherlands** displays some ups and downs but largely stays below 1.
     - **Sweden** shows a declining trend until around 2012, with slight improvements afterward but still below 1.

**Summary:**
The chart illustrates that immigrants tend to provide a fiscal boost in Anglophone countries like Australia, Ireland, UK, and US, indicating they contribute more in taxes than they receive in government spending. Conversely, in much of Europe (Belgium, France, Netherlands, and Sweden), immigrants are net recipients of government spending, with their fiscal contributions being less than what they receive. This suggests differing impacts of immigration policies and labor market integrations between these regions.
