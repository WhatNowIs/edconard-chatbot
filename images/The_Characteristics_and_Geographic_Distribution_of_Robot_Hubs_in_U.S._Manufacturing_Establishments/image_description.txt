This table presents the results of OLS regressions analyzing the influence of CBSA characteristics on the likelihood of being classified as a Robot Hub (dependent variable: Robot Hub Indicator). Key variables included in the regressions and their statistically significant coefficients (with significance levels indicated) are:

1. **Has Integrator**:
   - All coefficients are positive and highly significant (p<0.01) across columns (1-4), ranging from 0.1955 to 0.2465.
   
2. **Union Membership (%)**:
   - Positive and highly significant (p<0.01) across all columns, with coefficients around 0.0154 to 0.0164.

3. **Top Manufacturer 30 Yrs Prior**:
   - Negative but not significant across all columns.

4. **Share with High School Degree**:
   - Positive and significant (p<0.05) in column (3) with a coefficient of 0.01209.

5. **Share with Bachelor's Degree**:
   - Positive and significant (p<0.05) in columns (3) and (4), with coefficients 0.01598 and 0.01324 respectively.

6. **Share of STEM Workers**:
   - Not significant in any columns.

7. **Share of Production Workers**:
   - Positive and significant (p<0.05) only in column (5) with a coefficient of 0.02049.

**Observations**: There are 250 observations in each regression.

**R-squared** values range from 0.05146 to 0.133, indicating the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

### Summary
The factors "Has Integrator" and "Union Membership" consistently show a significant positive association with the likelihood of a CBSA being a Robot Hub. Education levels (both high school and bachelor degrees) also show some positive significance, while other factors like long-term manufacturing presence and share of STEM workers do not show consistent significant association. The share of production workers is significant only in one regression model. The model explains a modest amount of the variance (indicated by the R-squared values).
