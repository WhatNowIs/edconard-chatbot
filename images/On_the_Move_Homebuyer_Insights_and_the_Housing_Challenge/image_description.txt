The chart titled "Exhibit 3: Q1 2024 population change is largely driven by the younger generations (Gen Z/Millennials)" displays the net population change by generation (percentage year-over-year, Q1 2024) across major Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the United States. 

Key points from the chart include:

1. **Dominance of Younger Generations**:
   - The younger generations (Gen Z and Millennials) are driving the population change more significantly compared to Traditionalists/Baby Boomers in many MSAs.

2. **MSAs with Positive Growth**:
   - **Columbus and Austin** show the highest positive population growth driven by Gen Z/Millennials.
   - Other MSAs with notable positive growth in Gen Z/Millennials include Philadelphia, Tampa, Las Vegas, San Antonio, Charlotte, and Jacksonville.

3. **MSAs with Negative Growth or Smaller Positive Growth**:
   - **Miami and San Francisco** are experiencing negative net population change among younger generations.
   - New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago show minimal positive growth for both generations or a slight decline in older generationsâ€™ population.

4. **Traditionalists/Baby Boomers**:
   - In several cities, such as Detroit and D.C., there is a noticeable population decline among the older generation.
   - A few cities, like Phoenix, show minimal improvement in population among Traditionalists/Baby Boomers.

**Summary**:
The chart indicates a significant geographical shift in population dynamics in the first quarter of 2024, predominately driven by younger generations (Gen Z and Millennials). Cities like Columbus and Austin are particularly attractive to these younger demographics, whereas some larger metropolitan areas like New York and San Francisco either experience minimal growth or slight declines. Traditionalists/Baby Boomers generally see a decline in many cities, emphasizing the growing impact of younger age groups on urban demographics.
