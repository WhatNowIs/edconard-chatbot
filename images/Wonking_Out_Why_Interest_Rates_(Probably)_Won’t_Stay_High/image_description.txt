The graph illustrates the 10-year potential GDP growth from 1990 to 2020. Key points include:

- From 1990 to around 2000, the potential GDP growth rate was relatively high, hovering above 3%.
- Starting from the early 2000s, there was a significant decline in the potential GDP growth rate, dipping to around 2% by 2005.
- After 2005, the growth rate continued to decline slightly and stabilized at approximately 1.5% from around 2015 onwards.
- The caption at the bottom of the graph indicates a pessimistic outlook on growth, stating "Growth's glory days are gone," attributed to the Congressional Budget Office.

Overall, the graph shows a downward trend in potential GDP growth over the 30-year period, suggesting a long-term slowdown in economic growth potential.
