The chart titled "Figure 4. Natural Gas Inventories in the EU (End of Period)" tracks the levels of natural gas inventories in the European Union between January 2022 and June 2024. Key points include:

1. **Lines Representing Different Scenarios**:
   - **Bold black line**: Baseline scenario.
   - **Dashed gray line**: Average inventory levels from 2015 to 2021.
   - **Dashed red line**: Adverse scenario forecast.
   - **Dashed green line**: Harsh winter scenario forecast.
   - **Dashed blue line**: Storage capacity limit.

2. **Trends Overview**:
   - Gas inventories show seasonal fluctuations with higher levels in the summer months (June-Sept) and lower levels in winter (Dec-Feb).
   - Peak natural gas inventory was around 105 billion cubic meters in September 2022 under the baseline.
   - In 2022, inventory levels started below the 2015-2021 average, increased substantially through the summer and dropped again by January 2023.

3. **Future Projections**:
   - For 2023-2024, the baseline projection identifies another peak in September 2023 close to the storage capacity (around 104 billion cubic meters), followed by a decrease through the winter period.
   - Under harsh winter conditions, natural gas inventory would significantly decline, potentially dropping below 20 billion cubic meters by the end of February 2024.
   - Adverse scenario projects lower storage levels compared to the baseline but not as low as the harsh winter scenario.

4. **Storage Capacity**:
   - Storage capacity is indicated as a constant level around 115 billion cubic meters.

### Summary:
Between 2022 and 2024, EU natural gas inventories exhibit seasonal fluctuations with higher inventories in the summer and lower in the winter. The baseline scenario suggests that levels will peak during late summer, aligning closely with storage capacity. However, adverse conditions and particularly harsh winters could significantly deplete these inventories, especially impacting winter of 2023/2024. The chart is critical for understanding the anticipated strain on EU natural gas supply under various conditions, guiding preparedness and response strategies.
