   - All Buyback Companies: 4.10
   - No Buyback Companies: 29.02

**Summary:**
- Companies that did not engage in buybacks in 2022 have significantly higher debt loads, both in terms of Debt to Capital (66.16%) and Debt to EBITDA (29.02), compared to companies that performed buybacks. 
- The "Most Buyback Companies" and "All Buyback Companies" have relatively lower and fairly similar debt loads, with Debt to Capital percentages around 34-37% and Debt to EBITDA ratios around 4.1-4.2.
- This suggests a correlation between lower debt levels and higher instances of buybacks among US companies in 2022.
