This image is a visualization showing the distribution of SAT scores segmented by parent income rank. The x-axis represents the parent income rank from poorer to richer, ranging from the 10th percentile to the 99.9th percentile. The y-axis represents the percentage of students. The different shaded bands indicate ranges of SAT scores, such as less than 900, 900s, 1000s, 1100s, 1200s, 1300s, 1400s, and 1500s.

Key insights from the chart:

1. **Lower-Income Students:**
   - A higher proportion of students from lower-income families (towards the left side of the chart) did not take the SAT.
   - The SAT scores among those who took the test from this group are predominantly lower, with many scoring less than 900 and fewer scoring higher numbers like the 1200s and above.

2. **Higher-Income Students:**
   - Students from higher-income families (towards the right side of the chart) have a lower percentage of non-participants; most of them take the SAT.
   - Higher-income students achieve higher SAT scores, with a significant portion scoring between 1300 and 1500.

3. **General Trend:**
   - As the parent income rank increases, the likelihood of not taking the SAT decreases.
   - There is also a clear positive correlation between parent income rank and higher SAT scores: richer families tend to have children who score higher on the SAT.

This data suggests that family income can have a significant impact on both the likelihood of taking the SAT and the scores achieved, pointing to broader socioeconomic disparities in educational opportunities and outcomes.
