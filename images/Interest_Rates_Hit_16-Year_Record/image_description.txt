The image is a line graph titled "Rapidly Rising Interest Costs" which shows projected financial data from 2019 to 2033. The y-axis measures costs in billions of dollars, ranging from $0 to $1,800 billion. The x-axis spans from 2019 to 2033, with a vertical line marking the division between historic data and projected data.

Three main budget areas are compared:

1. **Net Interest (in red):** This line starts below $400 billion in 2019, sharply increases around 2023, surpasses both Defense and Medicaid costs by 2024, and continues to rise significantly higher. There are two projections for Net Interest, with one marked as "Net Interest (75bp above CBO)", indicating a steep increase up to $1,600 billion by 2033.

2. **Defense (in purple):** This line grows gradually from around $700 billion in 2019 to slightly above $1,000 billion by 2033.

3. **Medicaid, SNAP, SSI (in green):** This line increases slowly from approximately $400 billion in 2019 to about $800 billion by 2033.

Additional annotations indicate:
- "Hits New Record as Share of GDP" around 2027, associated with the rising Net Interest.
- The data sources are the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

The graph indicates that Net Interest costs are projected to rise sharply, surpassing other major budget items like Defense and Medicaid, SNAP, SSI, and could reach historic highs relative to GDP. This trend suggests significant fiscal challenges related to government debt interest payments in the coming years.
