The image is a graph titled "Figure 1. Top One Percent Income Shares in the US, 1960-2019," sourced from Auten & Splinter (2023) and Piketty and Saez (2003 and updates) for fiscal income. The graph depicts the percentage share of income held by the top 1% in the United States over time, from 1960 to 2019, differentiated by four categories:

1. **Fiscal Income (with capital gains)** - illustrated with a blue line.
2. **Pre-tax income** - illustrated with a green line.
3. **Pre-tax income plus transfers** - illustrated with a black dashed line.
4. **After-tax income** - illustrated with a red line.

Key observations:
- There is a significant increase in the share of fiscal income held by the top 1% from the early 1980s onwards, peaking around 2000 and 2007.
- Pre-tax income also shows a noticeable increase from the early 1980s, though not as pronounced as fiscal income with capital gains.
- The pre-tax plus transfers and after-tax income lines remain relatively stable, with some modest increases, indicating less volatility compared to fiscal income.
- The gaps between these lines suggest the influence of taxes and transfers in redistributing income.

In summary, the graph demonstrates substantial growth in the income share of the top 1% over the past few decades, especially when including capital gains, while tax and transfer mechanisms partially mitigate this concentration.
