The image displays a graph tracking the holdings of US Treasuries by different entities from 1997 to 2023 in trillion dollars (trn). The key entities include: Federal Reserve, Households, Real money, Foreign, and Banks. 

Here is a summary of the information:

- From 1997 to around 2008, there was a steady but low increase in holdings of US Treasuries across most entities.
- The Federal Reserve’s holdings began to spike significantly from 2008 onwards, reaching peaks around 2020.
- Foreign holdings increased consistently from 1997 until around 2013, stabilizing at high levels thereafter.
- Real money (institutional investors) holdings saw a gradual rise over the years with notable increases around 2019-2021.
- US Households' holdings remained relatively low throughout the period, with a marked increase starting from 2021.
- Banks' holdings fluctuated but started increasing significantly from 2020 onwards.
- Notably, the point where “Fed starts raising rates” (early 2022) marks a shift where the Federal Reserve and foreign entities began decreasing their holdings, while households and banks started increasing theirs.
