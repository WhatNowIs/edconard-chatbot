The images provide data on drug seizures at the US-Mexico southwest border, highlighting a significant rise in fentanyl seizures compared to other drugs over the past three years.

1. **Fentanyl Seizures**:
   - There has been a consistent and substantial increase in the amount of fentanyl seized from 2020 to 2023.
   - By 2023, seizures have escalated dramatically, surpassing all previous years within the three-year range. The data shows fentanyl seizures peaked in 2023 to levels well above 1300 kg.

2. **Comparison with Other Drugs**:
   - The rate of fentanyl seizures is distinctly higher than for other drugs like cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin when rebased to 2019 figures.
   - By 2023, fentanyl seizures have risen by about 150% from 2019 levels.
   - In contrast, seizures of other drugs:
      - Cocaine has modestly increased.
      - Methamphetamine and heroin seizures have decreased.

3. **Source**:
   - All data is sourced from US Customs and Border Protection.
   - The 2023 figures are annualized through three quarters, indicating that the data may reflect trends but is based on information up to that point in the year.

Overall, the imagery clearly indicates a sharp and unique surge in fentanyl seizures at the border compared to other drugs over the past three years.
