The provided image is a chart illustrating the surge in Russia's imports of CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine tools, with China becoming the primary supplier. 

Key points:
- The time span of the data ranges from January 2021 to mid-2023.
- The chart shows the total monthly value of CNC machine tools declared at Russian customs in millions of USD ($mn).
- The data is broken down by countries or regions of origin, including China, Taiwan, South Korea, the EU, Japan, and others.
- There is a notable increase in the import value starting around early 2022, with a significant rise continuing through to mid-2023.
- China has become the most prominent source, significantly contributing to the increase.
- Other countries or regions like Taiwan, South Korea, the EU, and Japan also have notable shares, but their contributions are smaller compared to China's.
- The overall trend indicates a growing dependency on Chinese CNC machine tools in Russia over the given period.

In summary, Russia has dramatically increased its imports of CNC machine tools since early 2022, with China emerging as the dominant supplier, indicating shifting trade patterns perhaps influenced by geopolitical factors.
