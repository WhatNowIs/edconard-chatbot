The chart titled "Figure 1. China's Investment, Total Consumption, and Household Consumption as Shares of GDP" illustrates the trends in China's economic distribution from 2000 to 2022. It captures three primary metrics: total consumption, total investment, and household consumption, each expressed as a share of GDP. Hereâ€™s a summary of the data:

1. **Total Consumption (Green Line):**
   - It started at slightly below 60% of GDP in 2000.
   - There was a steady decline until around 2010, where it fell to about 50%.
   - Post-2010, total consumption steadily increased until it peaked just above 55% around 2016-2018.
   - From 2018 onwards, total consumption slightly declined again but remained above 50% in 2022.

2. **Total Investment (Gray Line):**
   - In 2000, it was approximately 35% of GDP.
   - It saw an increase and peaked at just under 50% around 2010.
   - After 2010, total investment began a gradual decline.
   - By 2022, it stabilized around 40% of GDP.

3. **Household Consumption (Blue Line):**
   - Household consumption began at around 45% of GDP in 2000.
   - It maintained a steady decline throughout the years.
   - By 2022, household consumption had fallen to just below 40% of GDP.

Overall, the chart provides insight into China's economic priorities over the past two decades, indicating shifts between investment and consumption. Initially, there was a greater emphasis on investment until around 2010. After that, the trend shifted towards increasing total consumption, though household consumption continued to decline. This suggests changes in policy towards stimulating broader economic consumption rather than focusing solely on household consumption.
