2. **Population of Home-Buying Age (28-37 years):**
   - Period: 2010 to 2040 (projected)
   - Data Source: 2020 Census and Yi Fuxian's projections.
   - Key Observations:
     - The population of home-buying age saw a peak around 2015 and has been on a decline since.
     - According to the 2020 Census data, the population is projected to decrease steadily until 2040, with a more pronounced decline after 2025.

**Summary:**
The graphs indicate a significant rise in home prices in first-tier cities like Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing, with Shenzhen experiencing the most notable increase since 2010. Concurrently, there is a concerning decline in the population of individuals aged 28-37 over the same period, suggesting potential challenges for the housing market in these cities due to a shrinking demographic of home buyers.
