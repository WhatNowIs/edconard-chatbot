The chart, sourced from the Mortgage Bankers Association and Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, illustrates the year-over-year percentage change in commercial mortgage debt outstanding by investor type from 2008 to 2023. Here are the key takeaways:

1. **Banks (dark blue line)**: In general, banks have shown a positive growth trend in their commercial real estate (CRE) loan books over the period, with some fluctuations around economic events. There was noticeable growth after 2010 and a steady upward trend around 2015 to 2019. Post-2020, there is some volatility, but banks largely maintain a positive growth.

2. **Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (CMBS - light blue line)**: The CMBS market shows significant volatility. Post-2008 financial crisis, there was a sharp decline, followed by periods of growth and dips. A pronounced spike and subsequent drop are visible around 2020-2021.

3. **Non-bank Financial Institutions (cyan line)**: This category exhibits significant volatility throughout the period. There are sharp peaks and troughs, especially noticeable spikes around 2014-2015 and again in 2021, followed by sharp declines.

4. **Life Insurance Companies (yellow line)**: This group shows relatively stable and consistent growth trends over the period, with minor fluctuations, maintaining a largely steady upward trajectory.

The aggregate data suggest that banks have generally increased their CRE loan books on a year-over-year basis, experiencing more stability compared to non-bank financial institutions and CMBS. Life insurance companies have also shown consistent growth but at a steadier, more gradual rate.
