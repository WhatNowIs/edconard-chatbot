The image consists of two bar and line charts that present data on U.S. drug overdose deaths and drug-specific overdoses from 2015 to 2022, based on preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

**Summary:**

1. **Total U.S. Drug Overdose Deaths (Left Chart):**
   - The number of drug overdose deaths in the U.S. has shown a consistent upward trend from 2015 to 2022.
   - In 2015, there were approximately 50,000 deaths.
   - By 2022, the number of deaths has increased to around 100,000 annually, indicating a rising crisis in drug overdose mortality over these years.

2. **Overdoses by Type of Drug (Right Chart):**
   - **Synthetic Opioids (e.g., Fentanyl):**
     - Overdoses from synthetic opioids have dramatically increased; starting at around 10,000 in 2015 and escalating to nearly 70,000 by 2022.
   - **Psycho-stimulants (e.g., Methamphetamines):**
     - These overdoses have also risen steadily from about 10,000 in 2015 to more than 30,000 in 2022.
   - **Cocaine:**
     - Similar to psycho-stimulants, cocaine overdose deaths have increased from around 10,000 in 2015 to approximately 25,000 by 2022.
   - **Heroin:**
     - Heroin overdose deaths have remained relatively stable, with slight fluctuations ranging between about 10,000 and 15,000, peaking around 2017 and declining afterwards.

This data highlights a significant and escalating public health crisis, particularly involving synthetic opioids, which have become the primary driver of the increase in overdose deaths. The information underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions and policies to address the opioid epidemic and other drug-related issues.
