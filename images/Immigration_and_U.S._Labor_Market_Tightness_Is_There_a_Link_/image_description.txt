2. There is a noticeable shortfall between the actual number of foreign workers and the predicted trend line, especially from 2020 onward.
   
3. The gap between the actual and predicted number of workers reached a peak in 2021, with an average shortfall of 1.39 million workers.

4. The actual number of workers shows a sharp decline around 2020, possibly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a subsequent partial recovery.
