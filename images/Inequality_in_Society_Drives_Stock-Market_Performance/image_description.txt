The image is a graph showing the ratio of household equity wealth to demand-weighted income from around 1920 to around 2020. The vertical axis represents the ratio, while the horizontal axis represents the years.

Key observations from the graph:

1. Early 1920s: The ratio starts below 10.
2. 1929: There is a sharp increase in the ratio, peaking at around 25.
3. 1930s: A significant drop follows the peak, with fluctuations varying between below 10 to around 15.
4. 1950s-1970s: The ratio gradually increases, reaching a peak again at around 25 in the mid-1960s.
5. 1970s-1990s: There are notable fluctuations, with a few dips and peaks, the ratio generally stays between 10 and 20.
6. Early 2000s: Another peak occurs, reaching around 25.
7. Post-2000s: The ratio drops significantly but rises again, peaking around 20 during the mid-2010s.
8. Recent years (2020 and onwards): A sharp rise is observed, reaching close to 25 again.

Overall, the ratio of household equity wealth to demand-weighted income has exhibited several peaks and troughs over the 100-year period, with significant surges in the late 1920s, mid-1960s, early 2000s, and late 2010s/early 2020s.
