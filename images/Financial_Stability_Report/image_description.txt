The graph titled "Figure 2.1. The total debt of households and businesses relative to GDP declined further" illustrates the ratio of total debt of households and businesses to GDP in the United States from 1980 to 2022 on a quarterly basis.

Key points:
1. **Trend Over Time**: The ratio has fluctuated significantly over the given period, with notable peaks and troughs.
2. **Early Period (1980-2000)**: There is a gradual increase and moderate fluctuations in the ratio.
3. **Mid Period (2000-2010)**: The ratio increased more sharply, reaching a peak around 2010.
4. **Recent Period (2010-2022)**: After a peak, the ratio declined sharply and saw moderate fluctuations afterward. Noticeably, there is a significant spike around the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, followed by a decline.
5. **Recessions**: Shaded areas presumably represent periods of recession, where the debt-to-GDP ratio either stabilized or declined slightly before continuing its trend. These periods correlate with economic slowdowns in the early 80s, early 90s, early 2000s, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, and the COVID-19 recession.
6. **Recent Decline**: As of Q4 2022, the ratio has continued to decline from its peak during the pandemic, suggesting a reduction in household and business debt relative to GDP.

Source information attributes the data to the Federal Reserve Board staff calculations and multiple economic and financial accounts sources.

Overall, the graph depicts the long-term evolution of household and business debt relative to GDP, highlighting how economic events impact debt levels.
