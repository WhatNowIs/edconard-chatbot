- **Early 1900s**: Steel shipments began slightly above 10 million tons.
- **1920s to Early 1930s**: The shipments exhibited fluctuations but remained between 10 and 25 million tons.
- **1933**: A significant dip occurred, marking the lowest shipment level, under 10 million tons, likely due to the Great Depression.
- **1940s to 1950s**: Shipments sharply increased, peaking multiple times at over 35 million tons.
- **1960s to 1970s**: While still high, the shipments fluctuated between 25 and 35 million tons.
- **1980s onwards**: There was a sharp decline, with shipments dropping steadily and settling around or slightly above 10 million tons in the late 20th century.

This overview indicates that the highest shipments occurred in the mid-20th century, followed by a significant decline towards the end of the 20th century.
