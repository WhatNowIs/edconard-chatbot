This figure, titled "Historical Estimates of Fiscal R-Star and the Fiscal-Monetary Gap," presents three key elements over time: the Monetary r-star (in red), the Fiscal r-star (in blue), and the Fiscal-Monetary Gap (in green). The timeline covers the period from approximately 1870 to 2020.

1. **Monetary r-star (Red Line):** The Monetary r-star shows a relatively stable trend initially but exhibits fluctuations throughout the period. There is a noticeable decline around the 1950s, followed by stabilization and a gradual decline towards the end of the timeline.

2. **Fiscal r-star (Blue Line):** The Fiscal r-star initially trends higher than the Monetary r-star. Significant peaks and troughs are observed around major historical events such as the post-World War I era, the Great Depression, and post-World War II period. A general downward trend is seen from the mid-20th century onwards.

3. **Fiscal-Monetary Gap (Green Line):** The green line represents the gap between Fiscal and Monetary r-star. This gap shows substantial volatility, especially around significant economic events. The data reveal sharp increases around the early to mid-20th century and notable spikes in recent decades.

The graph uses dashed lines to represent medians of samples, while solid lines represent unweighted means. 

Overall, the figure highlights the varying historical relationship between fiscal and monetary interest rates, demonstrating periods of alignment and divergence, and indicating the varying influences of economic policy and historical events on these rates.
