The graph titled "Govt Deficit vs Bond Issuance (%GDP, 6mma)" displays the trends in government deficit and net bond issuance as a percentage of GDP from the year 2000 to 2025. Here are the key points from the graph:

1. **Government Deficit (Blue Line):** 
   - There is a notable spike around 2009-2010, aligning with the financial crisis period.
   - Another significant peak occurs around 2020, which corresponds with the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - After the 2020 peak, the deficit decreases sharply, followed by fluctuations and a slight increase in recent years.
   - The forecast for the deficit, indicated by blue dots, suggests it will stabilize around 5% by 2024.

2. **Net Bond Issuance (Red Line):**
   - The net bond issuance also follows a similar trend with sharp increases around the same crisis periods (2009-2010 and 2020).
   - Post-2020, unlike the deficit, the net bond issuance drops sharply to almost zero by 2022.
   - Small fluctuations are seen after 2020, hinting at lesser issuance relative to the deficit trends.

3. **CBO/OMB Baseline (Blue Dashed Line):**
   - The forecast indicates a stabilization around 5% GDP towards 2024.

4. **Forecast (Red Dots):**
   - Forecast points suggest that both the government deficit and net bond issuance will stabilize at around 5% of GDP in the near future.

5. **QT Starts (Vertical Grey Line):**
   - The vertical grey line at 2022 indicates the start of Quantitative Tightening (QT), signifying a change in monetary policy, likely influencing the deficit and bond issuance trends.

In summary, both the government deficit and net bond issuance have shown peaks around major economic crises, stabilizing in recent years with forecast stability around 5% of GDP by 2024. The introduction of Quantitative Tightening in 2022 marks a notable change in fiscal policy affecting these trends.
