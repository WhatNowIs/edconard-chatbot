The graph displays the distribution of output quality across various tasks and compares the performance between groups that used AI and those that did not. Key observations include:

1. **Performance of Groups:**
   - The blue area represents the group that did not use AI. 
   - The green and red areas represent the groups that did use AI, with the red group receiving additional training on AI usage.

2. **Quality Distribution:**
   - The quality scores of the group that did not use AI are centered around a lower value (around 4) with a peak density.
   - The quality scores of the groups that used AI show an improvement, centering around a higher value (around 6).
   
3. **Impact of AI:**
   - The graph illustrates a clear quality improvement from using AI across tasks, with a "Quality improvement from using AI across 18 tasks" labeled in the central area.

4. **Density Peaks:**
   - The highest density for the "Did not use AI" group (blue) aligns with a lower quality score.
   - The highest density for the "Used AI" group (green and red) aligns with higher quality scores.

5. **Additional AI Training:**
   - The red group's peak density, slightly higher to the right compared to the green group, indicates that additional AI training might further improve quality scores.

This data indicates that utilizing AI, especially with additional training, significantly improves the quality of the output in the tasks considered.
