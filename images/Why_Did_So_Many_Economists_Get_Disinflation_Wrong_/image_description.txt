The image is a graph from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data), showing the percent change from a year ago for three different price indices over time: 

1. **Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average (shown in blue)**
2. **Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers: All Items Less Food and Energy in U.S. City Average (shown in red)**
3. **Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP): All Items for United States (shown in green)**

**Time Period:**
- The data spans from January 2018 to July 2023.

**Key Observations:**
- **Pre-pandemic Stability:** From January 2018 to early 2020, the percent changes for all three indices were relatively stable, hovering around 2.5%.
- **Pandemic-Induced Fluctuations:** Around early 2020, coinciding with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a marked drop in all three indices, particularly in the green line (HICP).
- **Post-pandemic Surge:** Starting in mid-2020, all three indices witnessed a significant rise, peaking around mid-2022. The HICP displayed the most accentuated increase during this period, surpassing 10% at its highest point.
- **Recent Trend:** Post the peak, all three indices show a declining trend, with the HICP decreasing more sharply compared to the CPIs.

**Summary:**
The graph illustrates the volatility and inflationary trends in consumer prices over recent years. Consumer price indices remained stable before the COVID-19 pandemic, saw a short-term decrease followed by a sharp increase during the pandemic, and have been declining since their peak in mid-2022. The Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) experienced the most significant fluctuations during this period, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures showed less extreme variations but followed a similar overall trend.
