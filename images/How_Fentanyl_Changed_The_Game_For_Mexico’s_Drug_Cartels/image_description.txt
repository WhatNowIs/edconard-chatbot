The chart, sourced from the CDC and published by the Financial Times, illustrates the escalation in drug overdose deaths in the U.S. from 2015 to 2023, with a particular emphasis on synthetic opioids.

Key points from the chart include:
1. **Total Drug Overdose Deaths**: There's a significant increase over the years, particularly post-2019, reaching over 100,000 deaths by 2023.
2. **All Opioids**: These follow a similar upward trend, contributing massively to the overall drug overdose deaths, but not as sharply as the synthetic opioids.
3. **Synthetic Opioids (e.g., Fentanyl)**: The primary driver of the surge, these have shown a markedly sharp rise, dominating the proportion of opioid-related deaths.

The chart underscores that synthetic opioids are now causing far more deaths compared to other drugs, indicating a major public health crisis driven by substances like fentanyl. The observed trend reflects the growing impact and dangers of synthetic opioids relative to other types of drugs and opioids.
