The image depicts a graph titled "Average Annual Real Earnings Growth during Male Workersâ€™ Lifetime by Job Mobility." The graph compares earning growth between "Job Stayers" and "Job Switchers" across different percentiles of earners.

### Key Points:

1. **Axes and Labels:**
   - The x-axis represents the percentiles of earners, from 0 to 100.
   - The y-axis shows the percentage of average annual real earnings growth, ranging from 0% to 10%.

2. **Trends:**
   - Both job stayers (represented in red circles) and job switchers (represented in green triangles) show minimal growth for lower percentiles but significant growth for the highest percentile.
   - For lower earners (below the 50th percentile), job stayers and job switchers have relatively similar growth percentages, generally below 2%.
   - From around the 50th percentile onward, job switchers show higher average annual real earnings growth compared to job stayers.
   - This divergence becomes more pronounced in the upper percentiles (70th and above), where job switchers experience increasingly higher growth rates, surpassing 6% for the top earners.

### Summary:
The graph reveals that job mobility significantly impacts earnings growth over a male worker's lifetime. Workers who switch jobs tend to experience higher earnings growth, especially in the higher percentiles. This suggests that job switching is more beneficial for earnings growth in the upper income brackets, whereas the difference is marginal for lower earners.
