The image titled "Figure 3: Forecast of year-over-year shelter inflation: Full model" provides a graphical representation of both actual and forecasted changes in shelter inflation, measured year-over-year. 

Key points from the image:
1. The solid line represents the actual year-over-year changes in shelter inflation up to around early 2023.
2. The dashed line shows the average forecast for shelter inflation from early 2023 to the end of 2024.
3. There is a shaded area around the forecast line indicating a 95% confidence band, representing the range within which the actual inflation rates are likely to fall with 95% certainty.
4. The actual and forecasted values indicate a general decline in shelter inflation from around 10% in late 2022 to potentially below 0% by late 2024, based on the dashed forecast line.
5. The shaded confidence band widens over time, reflecting increasing uncertainty in the forecast further into the future.

Summary:
The figure illustrates a decline in year-over-year shelter inflation starting from around 10% in late 2022, with forecasted values potentially dropping below 0% by the end of 2024. The confidence band suggests a growing uncertainty in the predictions as the forecast extends further into the future.
