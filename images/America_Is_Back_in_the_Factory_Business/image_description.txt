The image is a bar chart depicting the construction spending related to manufacturing from 1993 to 2022, sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau. It displays spending in billions of dollars on both public and private construction projects post-2002. Key points include:

1. **Early Trends (1993-2000)**: Construction spending increased steadily from around $20 billion in 1993 to roughly $35 billion at the turn of the millennium.
   
2. **Fluctuating Period (2000-2010)**: Spending experienced fluctuations, peaking around $35 billion in 2000, dipping below $25 billion in the early 2000s, before gradually rising to around $50 billion by the 2010s.

3. **Growth Phase (2010-2022)**: From 2010 onwards, spending shows a more consistent growth pattern. Despite some periodic dips, the trend remained upward, with notable peaks in 2015 and 2020 at approximately $80 billion.

4. **Significant Peak in 2022**: There was a dramatic increase in construction spending in 2022, reaching an all-time high of $108 billion.

Overall, after a period of fluctuation in the early 2000s, construction spending related to manufacturing has seen robust growth, culminating in a significant rise in 2022.
