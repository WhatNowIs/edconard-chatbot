The chart titled "Figure 1: After-tax profit margins of non-financial corporate business" displays the percentage of after-tax profit margins with and without adjustments from 1950 to 2020. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Overall Trend**: The profit margins, both with and without adjustments, show substantial fluctuations over the seven decades.

2. **High Volatility Post-1950s**: There are pronounced peaks and troughs in both adjusted and non-adjusted profit margins in the early years (1950s), with margins initially above 15%.

3. **Steady Decline into 1970s**: Both lines show a general declining trend until the mid-1970s, with slight variations.

4. **Increasing Divergence Post-2000**: From the early 2000s, the profit margins without adjustments (blue line) generally trend higher compared to those with adjustments (red line), indicating increased divergence between the two metrics.

5. **Recent Increase**: Since the 2010s, both adjusted and non-adjusted profit margins have been rising, with notable peaks around 2020, reaching levels comparable to some of the highest points in the historical data.

6. **Periodic Fluctuation**: Periodic fluctuations are noticeable throughout the entire timeframe, indicating economic cyclicality affecting profit margins.

In summary, while after-tax profit margins for non-financial corporate businesses have experienced periods of both increase and decline, recent years (2010s onwards) have shown a notable increase, with the difference between adjusted and non-adjusted margins becoming more pronounced.
