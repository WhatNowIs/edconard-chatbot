The image presents a comparative analysis of global versus US financial metrics for public companies over the period from 1967 to 2019. The data is visualized across four graphs, each focusing on a specific financial metric. Here's a summary of each graph and the main insights:

1. **Global vs. US Capital (1967–2019)**:
   - This graph shows the aggregate capital (scaled) for global and US public companies.
   - The data indicates a steady increase over the years, with global public companies (red line, Compustat data) exhibiting a sharper rise compared to US public companies (blue line, SOI data) from around 2000 onwards.
   
2. **Global vs. US Investment (1967–2019)**:
   - This graph displays aggregate investment (scaled) trends.
   - Both global and US public companies show significant growth in investment, but the global companies experience more volatility, especially around the 2000 and 2008 financial crises.

3. **Global vs. US Revenues (1967–2019)**:
   - The graph depicts aggregate sales (scaled).
   - There is a clear upward trajectory in revenues for both global and US public companies. However, global companies consistently maintain higher aggregate sales figures, particularly noticeable from the early 2000s.

4. **Global vs. US Cash (1967–2019)**:
   - This graph illustrates the trend in aggregate cash (scaled).
   - While both sets of companies increased their cash holdings significantly, the pattern shows that global companies (red line) generally held more cash compared to US public companies (blue line), with marked divergence after 2000.

**Notes**:
- The figures utilize merged Compustat-SOI datasets, applying respective financial variables for global and US public companies to generate these aggregates.
- Financial metrics used are:
  - **Capital**: Net Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPENT)
  - **Investment**: Capital Expenditures (CAPX)
  - **Revenues**: Net Sales (SALE)
  - **Cash**: Sum of Cash and Short-Term Investments (CHE+IVAO)
- The distinction between pre- and post-1993 data is noted, particularly that pre-1993 SOI investment data only includes ITC-eligible basis, causing some underestimation.
- A significant increase in recorded capital is attributed to a change in accounting rules in the last year of Compustat PPENT data, which included capitalized operating leases.

The graphs collectively underscore the increasing globalization of investment trends, reflected by more pronounced growth and higher aggregates in global metrics compared to domestic (US) counterparts.
