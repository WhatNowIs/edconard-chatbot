The image presents a bar graph reflecting the annualized month-over-month growth rate of hourly nonsupervisory pay in private industries (excluding leisure, hospitality, and retail) from July 2022 to May 2024. Key highlights from the data and accompanying text are as follows:

1. **Steady Wage Growth**: There was consistent wage growth of around 5% annually for typical workers during the latter half of 2022 (H2) and throughout 2023.
   
2. **Notable Fluctuations**:
   - Peak growth occurred in March 2023, with the rate rising well above 7%.
   - Another significant peak was seen in January 2024.
   - Periodic dips are also visible, below the 5% mark, with the lowest in September 2022 and mid-2024.

3. **Recent Trends**:
   - The first four months of 2024 showed a lower average growth rate of 3.6% annualized, suggesting possible fluctuations or anomalies.
   - May 2024 saw a slight recovery to close to 5% growth.

4. **Red and Green Dotted Lines**:
   - A red dotted line indicates the approximate 5% growth trend up to 2023.
   - A green dotted line shows a slightly lower trend for early 2024.

5. **Analysis**: The title "Headfake?" and accompanying text imply uncertainty about whether the lower wage growth observed in early 2024 is an anomaly or suggests a new trend.

The source of the data is the Bureau of Labor Statistics, with calculations by Matthew Klein. This analysis suggests wage growth was robust through 2023, but the trend in early 2024 indicates some potential deviation that requires further scrutiny.
