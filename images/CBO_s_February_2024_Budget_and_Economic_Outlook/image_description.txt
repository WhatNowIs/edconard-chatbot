The graph titled "Fig. 1: Debt Held by the Public Under Current Law and Alternative Scenario (Percent of GDP)" displays the projected public debt as a percentage of GDP from 2019 to 2034 under three scenarios.

1. **May 2023 Current Law (Blue Line)**:
   - Shows a steady increase in debt, starting from about 97% of GDP in 2023.
   - By 2034, the debt is projected to be around 119% of GDP.

2. **February 2024 Current Law (Orange Line)**:
   - Follows a similar trend to the May 2023 projection but is slightly lower.
   - The debt in 2023 is roughly the same at 97%, gradually rising to about 116% by 2034.

3. **Alternative Scenario (Dashed Orange Line)**:
   - Projects a much steeper increase in debt.
   - The debt starts at around 97% of GDP in 2023 and rises more sharply compared to the current law scenarios, reaching approximately 131% by 2034.

**Summary**:
The graph illustrates projections of the U.S. public debt as a percentage of GDP, showing a significant increase over the years from 2019 to 2034. Under the May 2023 and February 2024 Current Law scenarios, debt rises steadily to 119% and 116% of GDP, respectively. The Alternative Scenario predicts a much higher increase, with debt reaching 131% of GDP by 2034. This indicates potential escalating debt issues if current policies are not adjusted.
