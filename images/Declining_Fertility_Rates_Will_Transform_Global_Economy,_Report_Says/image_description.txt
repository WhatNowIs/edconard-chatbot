The image illustrates global and regional trends in total fertility rates (children per woman) from 1950, 2020, and projected rates for 2100. It highlights how Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, and parts of Asia have contributed to a decrease in global fertility rates. Here are the key points:

1. **Global Trends**:
   - The global fertility rate has significantly declined from approximately 5 children per woman in 1950 to about 2.5 in 2020 and is projected to decrease further to around 1.5 by 2100.

2. **Regional Trends**:
   - **Sub-Saharan Africa**: The fertility rate has decreased from around 6.5 in 1950 to below 5 in 2020 and is expected to further decline to approximately 2.5 by 2100.
   - **South-east Asia**: From nearly 6 children per woman in 1950, the rate dropped to around 2.5 in 2020 and is projected to fall to below 1.5 by 2100.
   - **South Asia**: The fertility rate has fallen from about 6 in 1950 to slightly above 2.5 in 2020, with a further decline projected to under 1.5 by 2100.
   - **North Africa & Middle East**: Fertility rates have decreased from around 6 in 1950 to about 3 in 2020, and projections indicate a further drop to below 1.5 by 2100.
   - **Latin America & Caribbean**: Rates have significantly reduced from 6 in 1950 to just above 2 in 2020, with a projected dip to slightly below 1.5 by 2100.

This overall decline in fertility rates across various regions reflects significant changes in societal, economic, and health-related factors impacting birth rates globally over the past century and into the future.
