The image provides a comparison of the estimated natural rate of interest, denoted as \(r^*\), as estimated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (shown in blue) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (shown in orange) over an eight-year period from March 1, 2015, to March 1, 2023.

Key observations:
- Both the New York and Richmond estimations start at around 0.5 and 0, respectively, in early 2015.
- Between 2015 and 2018, both estimates exhibit a gradual upward trend.
- From 2018 to early 2020, the rates continue to rise, with periodic fluctuations.
- In early 2020, the Richmond Fed estimate shows significant volatility, including a sharp spike followed by a steep drop, whereas the New York Fed estimate remains relatively stable.
- By mid to late 2020, the Richmond estimate recovers and surpasses the New York estimate.
- From 2021 onwards, both estimates show an upward trend, with the Richmond Fed estimate frequently higher than the New York Fed estimate, and more volatile.
- By March 2023, the Richmond Fed's estimate reaches approximately 2.2, while the New York Fed's estimate remains stable at around 1.
