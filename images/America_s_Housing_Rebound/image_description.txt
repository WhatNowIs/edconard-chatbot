The image presents data on U.S. residential construction activity from January 2017 to 2023, showing the changes in thousands of units per month on a three-month moving average (3mma) basis. The data is split into four categories:

1. Single-family (permits)
2. Single-family (starts)
3. Multifamily (permits)
4. Multifamily (starts)

The primary findings indicate that despite a sustained increase in real mortgage rates since the end of 2021, homebuilding activity remains approximately 14% higher than in the years leading up to the pandemic. Notably, single-family construction starts are nearly 20% faster compared to the pre-pandemic period.

Key visual insights from the graph:
- There was a significant spike in construction activity around mid-2020.
- Single-family construction demonstrates a fluctuating but generally upward trend post-2021.
- Multifamily construction exhibits more variation but generally maintains an upward trend, especially in the early 2020s and late 2022.
