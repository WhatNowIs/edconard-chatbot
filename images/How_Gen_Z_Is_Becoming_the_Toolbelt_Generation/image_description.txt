This image presents data on two topics: enrollment growth in various educational institutions from 2019 to 2023 and the median age for select trades from 2013 to 2023.

**Enrollment Growth:**
- There are three categories shown for enrollment growth: 
  - All 4-year institutions (grey line)
  - Community colleges (yellow line)
  - Vocational-focused community colleges (light grey line)
- From 2019 to 2023, vocational-focused community colleges experienced significant growth, rising from around -10% to nearly 20%.
- Enrollment in community colleges initially dropped to almost -20% by around 2021 before recovering to just below 0% in 2023.
- Enrollment in 4-year institutions declined initially but remained relatively stable at around -5% from 2021 to 2023.

**Median Age for Select Trades:**
- The trades analyzed include:
  - Electricians (yellow line)
  - Carpenters (blue line)
  - Heating, air conditioning, refrigeration mechanics, and installers (grey line)
  - Welding, soldering, and brazing workers (black line)
  - Plumbers (light grey line)
- The median age for these trades generally hovered between 38 and 42 years over the period from 2013 to 2023.
- None of the trades saw a median age exceeding 44 years.
- There is some fluctuation in the median ages for all listed trades, with no consistent trend upwards or downwards. 

In summary, vocational-focused community colleges have seen a significant increase in enrollment over the past few years, while community colleges and 4-year institutions have faced varying levels of enrollment decline and stabilization. The median age for workers in selected trades has remained relatively steady between 38 and 42 years over a decade, reflecting a stable age demographic in these professions.
