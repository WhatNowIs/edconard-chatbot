The image provides an analysis of Chinaâ€™s economic performance through the relationship between investment and growth, illustrated by the incremental capital output ratio (ICOR), the investment share of GDP, and real GDP growth.

**Key points from the image:**

1. **Investment Levels**: The investment share of GDP (represented by the light blue bars) has remained consistently high over the years, especially from the mid-2000s onwards, staying around 40% or higher.

2. **Real GDP Growth**: The real GDP growth rate (indicated by the pink line) showed a generally declining trend. It peaked in the mid-2000s and then consistently dropped, especially after 2010, reaching notably lower levels in recent years.

3. **ICOR**: The ICOR (depicted by the dark blue line) reflects the efficiency of capital investment in generating economic output. It varies with a general upward trend, signaling increased inefficiency, particularly with several peaks around 2015 and 2020, indicating periods when more investment was needed to generate the same amount of GDP growth.

**Summary**:
China has maintained extremely high investment levels as a percentage of GDP; however, the growth rate of its real GDP has sharply slowed over the years. This slowdown is also accompanied by a rising ICOR, indicating diminishing returns on investments. Despite significant capital injection, the economy's growth momentum has weakened, suggesting inefficiencies in capital deployment over time.
