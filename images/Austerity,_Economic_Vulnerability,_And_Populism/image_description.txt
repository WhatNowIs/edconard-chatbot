This image is a graph showing the relationship between austerity measures and the marginal effect of lower secondary education on populism scores. Key points to note:

1. **X-Axis: Categories of Austerity**:
   - "No Austerity"
   - "Austerity"

2. **Y-Axis (Left side): Marginal Effect of Lower Secondary Education on Populism Score**:
   - The scale ranges from -0.1 to 0.4.

3. **Y-Axis (Right side): Frequency of Austerity in Percentage**:
   - The scale ranges from 0 to 60%.

4. **Data Representation**:
   - For "No Austerity":
     - The marginal effect of lower secondary education on populism score centers around 0.1-0.15.
     - There is a smaller confidence interval or variation illustrated by shorter error bars.
   - For "Austerity":
     - The marginal effect is significantly higher, around 0.3.
     - There is a larger confidence interval or variation illustrated by longer error bars.
     - Frequency of austerity is depicted to reach up to 60%.

**Summary**: The graph indicates that in the presence of austerity measures, the marginal effect of lower secondary education on the propensity for populism is significantly higher compared to the absence of austerity. This suggests that austerity measures may increase the impact of lower secondary education on favoring populist ideologies. The frequency of austerity also increases, suggesting a complex interaction between education level and economic policies/events like austerity measures.
