This graph compares the estimates of the natural rate of interest (r*) for the U.S. provided by the New York Fed and the Richmond Fed from Q1 2000 to Q2 2023. The natural rate of interest is depicted as a percentage and is represented by two lines: the blue line for the New York Fed and the red line for the Richmond Fed.

Key observations from the graph:

1. The estimates of r* have generally trended downwards from 2000 to around 2015 for both the New York Fed and Richmond Fed.
   - The New York Fed's estimates start at around 4% in 2000 and decline steadily, with some fluctuations, to close to 0% by 2015.
   - The Richmond Fed's estimates also start around 4% in 2000 and decline similarly, though with slightly different fluctuations, to about 1% by 2015.

2. From 2016 onwards, both estimates show some volatility, but the Richmond Fed’s estimates tend to be higher than the New York Fed’s estimates.
   - The New York Fed’s estimates slowly climb after hitting a low, but they hover around 0% - 1% until 2023.
   - The Richmond Fed's estimates rise more noticeably from around 2015, reaching a range of approximately 1.5% - 2.5% after 2015, and peaking higher after 2020.

3. Post-2020, the estimates show increased divergence with the Richmond Fed’s estimates climbing sharply while the New York Fed’s estimates demonstrate a slight upward trend but remain lower compared to the Richmond Fed.

Overall, while both estimates reflect similar directional trends, the Richmond Fed’s estimates of r* have been consistently higher, particularly from 2015 onwards.
