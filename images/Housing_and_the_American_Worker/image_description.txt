The figure titled "Wages less housing costs by skill group and commuting-zone population density" spans the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2019. It compares hourly wages (adjusted to 2000 USD terms using the PCEPI) less housing costs across different levels of commuting-zone (CZ) population density and skill groups. The skill groups are represented by blue circles for individuals with some college education or greater and red diamonds for those with a high school education or less.

Key observations:
1. **Overall Trend:** 
   - Individuals with some college or greater (blue circles) consistently demonstrate higher wages less housing costs compared to those with high school or less (red diamonds) across all years.
   
2. **Effect of Population Density:**
   - For individuals with some college education or greater, there is a positive correlation between higher population density and wages less housing costs. This relationship strengthens over the years as indicated by the steeper slopes of the blue lines in the later years.
   - For individuals with high school education or less, the correlation between population density and wages less housing costs is weak or negative, showing little change or even decreasing trends in some instances.

3. **Year-by-Year Analysis:**
   - **1970:** Both skill groups have relatively lower wages less housing costs across all population densities. The blue circle group shows a slight positive slope, while the red diamond group shows a slightly negative slope.
   - **1980** and **1990:** Gaps between the groups begin to widen, with the positive relationship between density and wages less housing costs becoming more pronounced for the blue circle group.
   - **2000:** The divergence is clear, with those having some college education or greater experiencing a substantial increase in wages less housing costs with higher population density, while there is no strong correlation for the high school or less group.
   - **2019:** The trend is most pronounced. Individuals with some college or greater in higher-density areas have significantly higher wages less housing costs, whereas the high school or less group shows a slightly downward trend or flat relationship.

In summary, the figure demonstrates that over the past five decades, the benefit of higher wages in high-density areas has been amplified for individuals with higher education, whereas individuals with lower educational attainment have not experienced the same upward trend in wages less housing costs with increasing population density.
