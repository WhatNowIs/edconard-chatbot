The chart in the image illustrates the relative exposure of various industries to automation by AI, segmented into three categories:

1. 0-10%: No Automation (dark blue)
2. 10-49%: AI Complement (light blue)
3. 50%+: Likely Replacement (grey)

### Key Insights:

- **Manual and Outdoor Jobs:**
  - Sectors like "Building and Grounds Cleaning and Maintenance," "Construction and Extraction," and "Food Preparation and Serving" show minimal exposure to automation, with the majority of employment remaining under "No Automation."

- **High Automation Complement:**
  - Industries such as "Healthcare Practitioners and Technical," "Management," "Business and Financial Operations," and "Computer and Mathematical" show a significant proportion (mostly light blue) where AI serves as a complement.

- **Significant Likelihood of Replacement:**
  - "Office and Administrative Support" and specific industry segments such as "Legal" exhibit a noticeable share under "Likely Replacement" (grey), indicating heightened susceptibility to automation.

- **Overall Trends:**
  - Most industries reflect a varied mix of exposure levels to AI, but there is a distinct tendency for manual and outdoor jobs to see little automation while roles involving cognitive, administrative, or technical skills indicate moderate to high exposure to AI as a complement or potential replacement.

- **Healthcare and Personal Care:**
  - While "Healthcare Support" has a significant portion in "No Automation," primary "Healthcare Practitioners and Technical" roles are predominantly in the "AI Complement" category, indicating their roles are enhanced rather than replaced by AI.

The chart emphasizes that while some sectors will see significant enhancements through AI, others, especially manual labor and administrative support, may experience higher rates of displacement due to automation.
