This graph depicts two key economic indicators in the United States from 1968 to 1985: the Federal Funds Effective Rate (blue line) and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers (red line). The graph helps illustrate the relationship between monetary policy and inflation over this period. 

### Key observations:

1. **Federal Funds Effective Rate:**
   - This is the interest rate at which depository institutions trade federal funds (balances held at Federal Reserve Banks) with each other overnight. 
   - There are notable peaks in this rate around 1973, 1980, and 1981-1982, where it reached its highest levels.

2. **Consumer Price Index (CPI):**
   - The CPI measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.
   - Inflation, represented by the percent change in the CPI from a year ago, exhibits significant increases around 1974, late 1970s, and early 1980s.

3. **Recessions:**
   - Gray shaded bars indicate periods of U.S. recessions. 
   - Notable economic downturns are seen in the mid-1970s, early 1980s, and another brief period thereafter.

### Relationship Insights:

- **1970s Inflation:** There is a significant rise in inflation (CPI) during the mid-1970s, peaking again in the late 1970s.
- **Monetary Policy Tightening:** The Federal Funds Rate increases sharply around the periods of high inflation, particularly in the early 1980s. This indicates a monetary policy response aimed at controlling inflation.
- **Recessions and Rate Changes:** Each noted recession follows a period of rising Federal Funds Rate, which suggests that the tightening monetary policy to control inflation may have contributed to economic slowdowns.

### Summary:

Overall, the graph highlights the volatility in both inflation and interest rates during the 1970s and early 1980s. It underscores the Federal Reserve's use of interest rate hikes as a tool to combat inflation, which in turn had significant impacts on economic activity, sometimes resulting in recessions.
