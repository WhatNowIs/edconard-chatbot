The top panel depicts Treasury yields, while the bottom panel shows futures rates.\n\n### Treasury Yields (Top Panel):\n- Two types of Treasury yields are plotted:\n  - Ten-year yield (red line)\n  - Two-year yield (blue line)\n- The interest rate sensitivities are generally around zero or negative until about late 2016, after which they gradually rise and exhibit higher volatility.\n- Post-2019, both yields show an increasing trend with notable surges around 2022. \n- The shaded blue areas represent the 95% confidence intervals calculated based on robust (White) standard errors.\n\n### Futures Rates (Bottom Panel):\n- Six different future contract rates are displayed:\n  - ED2 (brown line)\n  - ED4 (green line)\n  - ED6 (pink line)\n  - ED8 (cyan line)\n  - ED12 (yellow line)\n  - ED16 (violet line)\n- Initially, the futures rates remain close to or below zero until late 2016, similar to Treasury yields.\n- From then onwards, a gradual increase is visible, with fairly stable values until 2022.\n- Around 2022, a sharp increase is observed across all plotted futures rates.\n\n### Interpretation and Summary:\n- The sensitivity of both Treasury yields and federal funds rate futures to inflation news has significantly increased over the period observed, especially from late 2016 onwards.\n- Notable escalations are evident from 2022 onward, reflecting a heightened sensitivity of interest rates to inflationary information.\n- The confidence intervals indicate that despite these increases, there is a measure of statistical variability in these relationships.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe data suggest that interest rates, both short-term (futures rates) and long-term (Treasury yields), have become increasingly responsive to inflation news over the last decade, with particularly marked changes starting in 2022. This trend reflects evolving market conditions and could indicate more significant adjustments in response to future inflation reports.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 784, "completion_tokens": 434, "total_tokens": 1218, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_3537616b13"}}, "error": null}
