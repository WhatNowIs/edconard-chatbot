The chart illustrates the number of business applications in the United States from 2004 to 2022, emphasizing that many Americans believe the timing is favorable for starting a business. The data, sourced from the Census Bureau, shows a relatively stable level of business applications until around 2020. At that point, there is a significant spike, reaching a peak of approximately 600K applications, before settling down slightly but remaining considerably higher than pre-2020 levels. This sudden increase likely reflects a surge in entrepreneurial activity, possibly influenced by external factors around 2020. Despite some fluctuations, the trend suggests sustained interest and confidence in starting new businesses throughout this period.
