The image shows a line graph representing expected inflation rates over different periods from 2005 to May 2024. The graph specifically addresses:

- 10-year expected inflation (10y)
- 10-year expected inflation, 10 years from now (10y10y)
- 20-year expected inflation, 10 years from now (20y10y)

Three colored lines represent these periods:
- Blue line: 10y
- Orange line: 10y10y
- Gray line: 20y10y

A dashed line at the 2% level indicates the target inflation rate. 

Over the observed period:
- Expected inflation has experienced fluctuations, with noticeable declines around the 2008 financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
- Generally, there have been periods where expected inflation rates were below the target, especially noticeable in the 10y and 20y10y series.
- The 10y10y inflation expectation tends to hover around and occasionally surpass the 2% target more frequently compared to the other two series.

Data for the graph was sourced from St. Louis FRED and J. Rangvid, covering the periods from 2005-May 2024 for the 10y and 10y10y, and from 2010-May 2024 for the 20y10y.
