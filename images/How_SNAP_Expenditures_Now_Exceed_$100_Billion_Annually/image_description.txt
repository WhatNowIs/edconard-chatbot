The image depicts a line graph titled "Figure 1: SNAP Annual Participation and Costs (2021$): 2000-2021," along with projections up to 2032. The graph details the average monthly participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and its annual costs, both adjusted to 2021 dollars.

Key Points:
1. **Axes**:
   - The left vertical axis indicates the average monthly SNAP participants in millions of people.
   - The right vertical axis indicates the annual costs in billions of 2021 dollars.
   - The horizontal axis spans the years from 2000 to 2032.

2. **Trends**:
   - **Average Monthly SNAP Persons**: The number of participants rose steadily from about 17 million in 2000 to a peak of about 48 million in 2013. It then declined to approximately 35 million in 2020 before rising again in 2021.
   - **Annual Cost**: The annual costs followed a similar trend, increasing sharply from approximately $35 billion in 2000 to a peak of around $120 billion in 2021.

3. **Projections**:
   - The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections suggest the annual cost will decrease sharply after 2021, stabilizing around $100 billion by 2026, and then slightly increasing again up to 2032.
   - The number of participants is projected to decline and stabilize around 35 to 40 million from 2022 onwards.

4. **Sources**: The data is sourced from USDA FNS Snap Participation and Costs and CBO May 2022 Baseline Projections.

In summary, the graph illustrates a steady rise in both the number of SNAP participants and program costs from 2000 to 2013, followed by a decline before a sharp rise again in 2021. Future projections by the CBO indicate a potential decrease and stabilization in both participation and costs.
