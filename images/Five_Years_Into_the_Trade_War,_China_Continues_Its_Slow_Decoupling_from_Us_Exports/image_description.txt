The chart titled "US exports to China continue to struggle" illustrates the value of US exports to China in billions of USD from 2009 to 2022, specifically focusing on goods and services covered by the Phase One deal. The timeline shows actual exports alongside projected purchases under different scenarios: no trade war, the onset of a trade war, and the Phase One agreement.

Key Points:
1. **Actual Exports**: The actual exports (marked by a solid line) show a general upward trend from 2009 to 2017. However, these exports decline during the trade war period starting around 2018.
2. **Trade War and Phase One**: The chart is segmented into periods to indicate the timing of the trade war and the subsequent Phase One agreement. During the trade war (2018-2019), actual exports declined and then stayed relatively flat post-phase one (2020-2022), indicating limited recovery.
3. **Projections Without Trade War/Phase One**: A dashed line represents projected purchases assuming no trade war or Phase One agreement. This projection shows a continued rise in exports which diverges significantly from the actual export data during the trade war and beyond.
4. **Total Purchase Commitment**: There is another projection (dotted line) showing total purchase commitments as per the Phase One deal. This line is markedly higher than both the actual exports and the no-trade-war projections, indicating ambitious targets set by the agreement.
5. **Baseline Comparison**: The 2017 baseline is provided as a reference point for comparing changes in export values over time.

In summary, despite the Phase One deal's purchase commitments, actual US exports to China have struggled to meet projected targets after the trade war, showing a stark contrast between expectations and reality.
