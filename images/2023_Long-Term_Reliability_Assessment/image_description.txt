The image represents a Risk Area Summary for electricity supply from 2024 to 2028 across various regions in North America. The risk assessment is classified into three categories:
- **High Risk (red)**: Indicates areas where electricity shortfalls may occur under normal peak conditions.
- **Elevated Risk (orange)**: Indicates areas where electricity shortfalls may occur in extreme conditions.
- **Normal Risk (blue)**: Indicates areas with a low likelihood of electricity supply shortfall.

### Key Regions and Risk Classifications:
1. **High Risk Regions**:
   - MISO (Midcontinent Independent System Operator)
   - SERC-Central
   - SERC-E (Southeast Electric Reliability Corporation - East)
   - SPP (Southwest Power Pool)
   
2. **Elevated Risk Regions**:
   - NPCC-New York
   - NPCC-New England
   - NPCC-Ontario
   - WECC-CA/MX (Western Electricity Coordinating Council - California/Mexico)
   - WECC-NW (Western Electricity Coordinating Council - Northwest)
   - WECC-SW (Western Electricity Coordinating Council - Southwest)
   
3. **Normal Risk Regions**:
   - NPCC-Quebec
   - NPCC-Maritimes
   - PJM
   - SERC-SE (Southeast)
   - Texas RE-ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas)
   - MRO-Manitoba Hydro
   - MRO-SaskPower
   - WECC-AB (Alberta)
   - WECC-BC (British Columbia)

### Summary:
The map illustrates varied levels of electricity supply risk across North America for 2024-2028. Significant concern (high risk) centers around the MISO, SERC-Central, SERC-East, and SPP regions, while moderate concern (elevated risk) is noted in multiple areas, including parts of the NPCC, WECC, and western regions. Only a few regions, primarily in the north and southeast, display a normal risk with a low likelihood of electricity shortfall.
