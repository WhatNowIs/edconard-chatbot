The image is a graph showing the labor productivity (output per hour) for all workers in the nonfarm business sector of the U.S. economy from around 1970 to around 2010. The data is indexed to the year 2012 (with 2012 = 100), and the y-axis represents the natural logarithm of this index. 

Key points from the graph:

1. **Time Span:** The graph covers labor productivity data from approximately 1970 to 2010.
2. **Productivity Trend:** There is a visible increase in labor productivity over the entire period.
3. **Pre-1995 Trend Line:** A red line indicates the pre-1995 trend in productivity growth, showing a steady, linear increase.
4. **Deviation Post-1995:** After 1995, the actual productivity (blue line) increases at a faster rate compared to the pre-1995 trend line, suggesting a significant uptick in productivity growth post-1995.
5. **Data Source:** The information is sourced from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the graph is provided by FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) from the St. Louis Federal Reserve.

The graph thus highlights a marked increase in productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector starting around the mid-1990s, deviating from the previous steady trend.
