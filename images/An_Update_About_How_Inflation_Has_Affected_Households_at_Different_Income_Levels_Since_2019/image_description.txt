The image presents data from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) showing changes since 2019 in the share of household income required to purchase a 2019 consumption bundle, categorized by income quintile. The key points are:

1. **Change in Share of Adjusted Income After Transfers and Taxes**:
   - For all income quintiles (lowest to highest), the share of adjusted income needed to buy the 2019 consumption bundle decreased by 2023.
   - The highest quintile experienced the most significant decrease, indicating that their adjusted income increased more than prices from 2019 to 2023.

2. **Change in Share of Adjusted Market Income**:
   - Similar to adjusted income after transfers and taxes, all quintiles saw a decrease in the share of adjusted market income needed for the 2019 consumption bundle by 2023.
   - The largest decrease was observed in the highest quintile, suggesting a notable rise in adjusted market incomes over the period.

3. **Summary Points**:
   - In 2023, households in all income quintiles were able to purchase the same bundle of goods and services as in 2019 with a smaller portion of their income, reflecting income growth outpacing price increases.
   - This trend was true for both adjusted income after transfers and taxes and adjusted market income.
