The image contains a line graph titled "Inland Upside" which illustrates the growth in export indexes for various regions and countries from January 2018 to 2023. The main takeaway from the chart is that exports from China’s central and western provinces are growing faster than exports from rival manufacturing destinations. 

Key points:
- The graph tracks export growth for five specific regions/countries: China's coast, China's inland, India, Vietnam, and Mexico.
- Each region/country is represented by a different line color:
  - China's coast: Light red
  - China's inland: Dark red
  - India: Black
  - Vietnam: Olive green
  - Mexico: Gray
- The base value for the export indices is set to 100 on January 1, 2018.
- By comparing the lines, it is evident that the export growth rate of China’s inland regions has surged significantly more than other regions, particularly after 2020.
- While other areas like Vietnam also show significant growth, they still fall behind China's inland growth trend.
- Notably, export indexes for coastal China, India, and Mexico have risen at a more moderate pace.
- The data source for this graph is CEIC, and it is reflective of a period from 2018 to early 2023.
