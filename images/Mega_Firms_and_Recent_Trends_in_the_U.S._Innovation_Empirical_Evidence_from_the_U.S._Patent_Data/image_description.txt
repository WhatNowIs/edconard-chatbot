The image displays a bar chart comparing the percentage of new technological combinations used by firms in two distinct periods: 1991-2000 (shown in blue) and 2007-2016 (shown in orange). The analysis segregates data into "Mega Firms" and "Startups" and further categorizes them into "Top 1% New Combinations" and "All New Combinations."

Key observations:
1. **Mega Firms (Top 1% New Combinations)**:
   - In 1991-2000: 11.90%
   - In 2007-2016: 21.20%
   
2. **Mega Firms (All New Combinations)**:
   - In 1991-2000: 9.30%
   - In 2007-2016: 12.90%
   
3. **Startups (Top 1% New Combinations)**:
   - In 1991-2000: 14.50%
   - In 2007-2016: 19.80%
   
4. **Startups (All New Combinations)**:
   - In 1991-2000: 7.40%
   - In 2007-2016: 8.90%

Summary:
The chart demonstrates that both mega firms and startups have increased their percentage of new technological combinations from the period 1991-2000 to 2007-2016. Notably, mega firms have significantly increased their share of the top 1% of new combinations, more than startups. Startups, while showing substantial growth, have a slightly smaller percentage increase in the top 1% compared to mega firms. Overall, this suggests a trend toward a higher rate of innovation and technological combination among both types of firms over time.
