The image presents Figure 3 titled "Adjusted Profit Margins," depicting the aggregate non-financial corporate profit margins over time, alongside adjusted profit margins.

Key details include:

- The actual profit margins, shown with a red solid line, are plotted from the first quarter of 1999 (1999q1) to the first quarter of 2022 (2022q1).
- The adjusted profit margins, depicted with a dashed black line, represent the counterfactual scenario where government and net interest components remain constant at their 2019 fourth quarter (2019q4) values for the period of 2020q1 to 2022q4.
- The chart shows fluctuations in profit margins over the years, with notable peaks and troughs, including a significant drop around 2020, followed by a sharp increase and stabilization.
- The source of data includes the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and authorâ€™s calculations.

Summary:
The figure visualizes the changes in non-financial corporate profit margins from 1999 to 2022, comparing actual margins with adjusted margins assuming constant governmental and net interest components from 2019q4. The data reveals fluctuations over the years, with significant volatility particularly post-2020. The comparison aims to highlight the potential impacts of adjusting these specific economic factors on profit margins.
