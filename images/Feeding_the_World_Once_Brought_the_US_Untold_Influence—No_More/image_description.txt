The image presents data on the US share of global shipments for three major crops—Wheat, Corn, and Soybeans—over time, measured per crop year from 1970 to 2024. The information is sourced from the US Department of Agriculture, and 2023 and 2024 are projections.

Here are the key points:

1. **Wheat:**
   - The US share of global wheat shipments has declined significantly from nearly 100% in 1970 to nearly 0% by 2024.
   - A notable drop occurred post-2014 when the European Union became the top exporter.

2. **Corn:**
   - The US share of global corn shipments was close to 100% in 1970, fluctuated until around 2013, but has significantly decreased since then and is projected to be near 0% by 2024.
   - A critical moment occurred in 2013 when Brazil and Argentina became the top exporters.

3. **Soybeans:**
   - The US initially held close to 100% of global soybean shipments in 1970 but has seen a steady decline since.
   - Brazil overtook the US as the top exporter in 2006, with the US share projected to approach 0% by 2024.

This data highlights significant shifts in global agricultural export leadership over the past several decades, with the US losing its dominant position to other major producers such as the EU for wheat, and Brazil and Argentina for corn and soybeans.
