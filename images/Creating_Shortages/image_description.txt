The image presents a graph depicting the relationship between the net percent of banks tightening standards for construction loans (in blue) and the total value of construction and land development loans in billions of dollars (in orange, plotted on the right y-axis) over a period from January 2019 to January 2024.

Key observations are:

1. **Trend of Banks Tightening Standards (Blue Line)**:
   - From January 2019 to around January 2020, the percentage remained relatively low and stable, with slight fluctuations.
   - A significant increase started around mid-2020, peaking at approximately 80% around January 2021.
   - Post January 2021, a decline is observed, reaching slightly negative territory by July 2021.
   - Another rise occurs towards January 2023 but drops again sharply afterward.

2. **Trend of Construction and Land Development Loans (Orange Line)**:
   - Constructed loan values start at around $360 billion in January 2019 and remain relatively stable with gradual increases until mid-2021.
   - Post mid-2021, a noticeable increase occurs, peaking around $480 billion from mid-2022 to early 2023.
   - A decrease trend follows from mid-2023, returning towards the $380 billion mark by January 2024.

**Summary**:
The graph illustrates that there has been significant fluctuation in the net percent of banks tightening standards for construction loans, especially a sharp peak around early 2021 followed by a decrease. Concurrently, the value of construction and land development loans has generally trended upward, peaking in early 2023 before starting to decline. The source of this data is attributed to the Federal Reserve. This suggests that while lending standards became stringent during certain periods, the overall loan value continued to rise until reaching a peak, indicative of a complex interplay between lending standards and loan value dynamics.
