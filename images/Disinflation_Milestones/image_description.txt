The image is a composite graph illustrating disinflation episodes, focusing on the year-on-year percentage changes across three metrics in the Euro Area (EA):

1. **GDP Deflator (Panel A)**
2. **Nominal Wages (Panel B)**
3. **Real Wages (Panel C)**

Each panel illustrates data spanning several years around key quarters of significant economic interest.

### Key Insights:

#### Graph A: EA GDP Deflator
- **Q4 1974**: Sharp increase just before Q0, reaching a peak close to 13%, followed by a pronounced drop.
- **Q4 1981**: Gradual decline around Q0, starting just below 10% and steadily reducing post-Q0.
- **Q3 1991 & Q3 2008**: These show relatively moderate trajectories with minor fluctuations around Q0.
- **Q4 2011** & **Q4 2022**: Exhibit the least variation with Q4 2022 showing a dip slightly below zero just after Q0.

#### Graph B: EA Nominal Wages
- **Q4 1974**: Starts at a high around 15%, gradually decreasing but staying above 10% post-Q0.
- **Q4 1981**: Declines from around 13% to below 5% after Q0.
- **Q3 1991**: Displays moderate variations, mostly staying between 0% and 5%.
- **Q3 2008** & **Q4 2022**: Relatively stable around 2% to 5% before and after Q0 with slight dips.
- **Q4 2011**: Shows a mild decrease and remains stable around 1% post-Q0.

#### Graph C: EA Real Wages
- **Q4 1974**: Fluctuates around 3% to 4% before Q0, then declines but stays positive.
- **Q4 1981**: Exhibits a consistent decline, turning negative gradually post-Q0.
- **Q3 1991**: Shows an uptrend prior to Q0, followed by an inconsistent pattern but stays positive.
- **Q3 2008**: Minor fluctuations around zero, indicating stability.
- **Q4 2011**: Declines significantly before Q0, going negative, then gradually recovering.
- **Q4 2022**: Shows a significant drop just before Q0, turning negative but recovering slightly post-Q0.

### Overall Summary:
The graphs highlight:
- Historical periods of significant disinflation in the EA, encapsulating fluctuations in GDP deflator, nominal wages, and real wages.
- Each episode has unique characteristics, revealing the economic conditions and the aftermath of various disinflationary periods.
- Real wages often follow the trends of nominal wages adjusted for inflation, indicating real economic impacts on purchasing power.

These insights provide a detailed longitudinal economic understanding during key disinflation periods in the Euro Area.
