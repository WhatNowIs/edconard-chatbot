The image is a graph showing the comparison of U.S. federal spending on net interest, defense, Medicare, and Medicaid from 2015 to 2034. The lines representing these categories include:

- Net Interest (in red)
- Defense (in orange)
- Medicare (in green)
- Medicaid (in blue)

Key points highlighted on the graph are:

1. By 2023, spending on net interest is projected to exceed spending on Medicaid.
2. By 2024, spending on net interest is projected to surpass both defense and Medicare costs.

The graph is based on data from the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget, with the following trends:
- Net interest costs see a steep increase from 2022 onwards.
- Defense spending remains relatively stable over the years.
- Medicare and Medicaid both show a steady upward trend.
- Medicare costs notably increase sharply, whereas Medicaid costs increase at a more moderate pace.

By 2034, net interest costs are anticipated to be significantly higher than defense and even higher than Medicare and Medicaid expenditures.
