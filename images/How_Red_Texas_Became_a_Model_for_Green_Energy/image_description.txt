The provided graph demonstrates the growth of installed utility-scale solar capacity in Texas and California from 2010 to projections for 2024, measured in gigawatts (GW). 

Key points:
1. **Steady Growth in California**: California's solar capacity has shown a consistent increase from 2010 through 2023.
2. **Rapid Growth in Texas**: Texas started with relatively low solar capacity but has experienced significant acceleration, particularly post-2020.
3. **Texas Overtakes California**: By around 2023, Texas has surpassed California in total installed utility-scale solar capacity.
4. **Future Projections**: The trend lines suggest Texas will continue to extend its lead significantly over California through 2024.

Summary:
Texas is significantly outpacing California in building and connecting new grid-scale solar facilities. Starting with a much lower baseline in 2010, Texas’s solar capacity saw exponential growth, especially post-2020, bypassing California by 2023 and is projected to widen its lead further by 2024. This reflects Texas’s rapidly increasing commitment to solar energy infrastructure in comparison to the steadier yet slower growth seen in California.
