The image provides two graphs under the title "Figure 1: Student Loan Balances and Payments." The graphs illustrate student loan payments and balances over time, with specific key dates emphasized.

**Payments Graph (Left):** 
- The Y-axis represents the level of student loan payments.
- The X-axis spans from early 2019 to late 2022.
- There is a noticeable sharp decline in payments around the beginning of 2020, coinciding with the announcement of the payment moratorium.
- Following this decline, payments remain low but start to slightly increase around mid-2021, maintaining a gradual upward trend through the rest of the period.

**Balances Graph (Right):** 
- The Y-axis measures student loan balances.
- The X-axis covers a similar time period, from early 2019 to late 2022.
- Balances remain relatively stable until early 2020, where there is a marked upward trend coinciding with the payment moratorium period.
- The upward trend continues, showing a steep increase after mid-2021, and balances reach their highest levels by late 2022.

**Overall Summary:**
- The provided figure presents student loan payments and balances over a period from the beginning of 2019 to the end of 2022.
- The payment moratorium, which began around early 2020, led to a significant reduction in payments, as shown by the sharp drop in the payments graph.
- Correspondingly, student loan balances began to rise steadily during this period, indicating that although payments decreased, balances grew.
- Both graphs include 95% confidence intervals, and fixed effects are accounted for individual and initial loan payment deciles.
- Key dates are marked by solid and dashed lines, reflecting important periods such as the payment moratorium and forgiveness announcements.
