The graph in Figure 2, titled "Patents, Creative Patents, and Productivity Growth," displays data on the factor increase in patents and creative patents per capita since 1930 and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth. The data spans from 1930 to around 2010.

### Key Points:
1. **Patents per Capita (dashed blue line)**:
   - Show fluctuations throughout the years.
   - Steady increase starting from 1990, peaking around 2010.
   
2. **Creative Patents per Capita (dashed green line)**:
   - More stable and lower than total patents per capita.
   - Show a slight increasing trend in recent decades but did not reach the high levels of total patents.

3. **TFP Growth (gray shaded areas)**:
   - TFP growth shows several peaks and troughs.
   - Significant peaks in the periods around the 1940s, 1960s, 1980s, and a noticeable peak from around 1990 to 2000.
   - Shows a drastic increase around the late 1990s, continuing into the early 2000s before declining quickly towards 2010.

### Summary:
The graph illustrates a historical perspective on patents and productivity growth in the U.S. since 1930. It depicts the interplay between the number of patents (both general and creative) per capita and TFP growth. From the early 1990s onwards, there is a noticeable sharp increase in patents per capita which aligns with a notable rise in TFP growth, peaking around 2000. However, despite this rise in the number of patents, the frequency of creative patents per capita remains relatively stable and does not show as dramatic an increase. The TFP growth has seen substantial fluctuations over the decades, with significant peaks during key periods but a decline nearing 2010. This suggests that while the quantity of patents has surged, the efficiency advancements contributing to productivity have varied distinctly over time.
