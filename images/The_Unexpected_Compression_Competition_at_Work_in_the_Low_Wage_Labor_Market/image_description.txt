The graph titled "Real Hourly Wages by Occupational Wage Tercile, Relative to January 2020" provides a comparative analysis of the hourly wages across three occupational wage tiers: low-wage, mid-wage, and high-wage occupations from January 2015 to July 2022. 

Key points include:

1. **Pre-pandemic Trends (2015-2019):**
   - Low-wage occupations (red) generally had wages fluctuating slightly below the baseline (0.94-0.98).
   - Mid-wage occupations (green) displayed a similar fluctuation pattern, though they were positioned slightly higher than low-wage occupations (0.96-1.00).
   - High-wage occupations (blue) mostly remained steady around 0.98-1.00.

2. **Pandemic Impact (2020 onwards):**
   - Around early 2020, low-wage occupations saw a sharp increase and peaked just above 1.05 by mid-2020, maintaining higher variance but generally above the 1.00 mark until mid-2021, before declining.
   - Mid-wage occupations depicted a temporary surge similar to low-wage occupations, peaking around 1.03 in mid-2020, then saw fluctuations before declining to below 0.98 by mid-2022.
   - High-wage occupations experienced a relatively smaller increase and later a steady decline, reaching approximately 0.95 by mid-2022.

3. **Recent Trends (2021-2022):**
   - Low-wage occupations faced a drop in hourly wages index but showed signs of stabilization around mid-2022.
   - Mid-wage and high-wage occupations continued to decline steadily with high-wage experiencing the largest drop relative to 2020.

The data used is based on CPS monthly data, adjusting for different demographic factors and smoothed using a 3-month moving average. The wages are represented in constant 2022:Q3 USD for standardization.
