The image depicts a graph from Bloomberg and Apollo Chief Economist, analyzing multiple economic indicators tracked by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) to determine if they signal a recession. It plots year-over-year (% yoy) changes in the following indicators:

- NFP (Non-Farm Payroll) Employment
- Employment by the household survey
- Real Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)
- Real personal income less transfers
- Industrial Production (IP)
- Real retail sales
- Real wholesale sales

The graph covers data from January 1999 to January 2023. Key takeaways include:

- There have been noticeable drops in several indicators during past recessions, particularly around the early 2000s, the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
- During these recessionary periods, a downward trend is observed across all indicators.
- Despite past recessions, the current trends as of January 2023 show no significant declines in these indicators, suggesting that the NBER indicators are not currently signaling a recession.
- The graph provides a comprehensive historical perspective on economic cycles, showcasing periods of recovery and downturns and the behavior of key economic measures during these times.

Overall, the summary emphasizes that even though there have been economic downturns in the past, the latest data suggests that the economy is not immediately heading towards another recession based on the indicators presented.
