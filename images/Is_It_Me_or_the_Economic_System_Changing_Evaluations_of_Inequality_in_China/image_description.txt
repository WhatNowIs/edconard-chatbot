The image presents a bar graph titled "Figure 6: Explanations for Why People in China Are Poor," which is sourced from the manuscript "Getting Ahead in Todayâ€™s China" by Rozelle, Alisky, and Whyte (2024). The graph shows the proportion of respondents who believe that various factors have a "large influence" or "very large influence" on why people in China are poor.
