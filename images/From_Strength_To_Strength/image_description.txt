The chart from The Economist, using data from the IMF, illustrates the United States' GDP as a percentage of the G7 countries from 1980 to 2022, measured in both nominal terms and in purchasing-power-parity (PPP) terms.

Key insights from the graph:

1. **Nominal GDP**: The dark blue line representing the GDP in nominal terms shows a steady increase from around 43% in 1980 to about 50% in 2022.

2. **PPP GDP**: The light blue line representing GDP in purchasing-power-parity (PPP) terms fluctuates more significantly. It starts at around 45% in 1980, shows considerable volatility through the late 80s and 90s, and then rises sharply after 2015, reaching approximately 55% in 2022.

3. **Trend Stability**: There is a noticeable period of greater stability in nominal terms compared to PPP terms.

The summary effectively emphasizes that the US GDP has been growing both in nominal and PPP terms, with nominal GDP showing steady growth over the years and PPP GDP reflecting more significant fluctuations but converging to a higher percentage in the more recent years.
