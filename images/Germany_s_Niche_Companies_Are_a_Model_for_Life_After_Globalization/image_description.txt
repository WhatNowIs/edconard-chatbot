The image contains a bar chart titled "Where Are the World's 'Hidden Champions'?" and highlights the number of such companies by country, based on data from the Institute of German Economics (September 2022). The term "hidden champions" refers to relatively unknown companies ranking in the top three of their global markets or first on their continent, with annual revenues of less than $5.5 billion.

Key Highlights:
1. **Germany** leads significantly with the highest number of hidden champions, nearly reaching 2,000.
2. **United States** follows but with considerably fewer hidden champions, in the range of several hundred.
3. **Japan**, **Austria**, and **Switzerland** are the next top contributors, each having notable numbers of hidden champions, but less than the United States.
4. **France**, **Italy**, and **China** also feature, with each having a moderate number of such companies.
5. Several other countries, including the **United Kingdom**, **Netherlands**, **Poland**, **Russia**, **Finland**, **Sweden**, **Canada**, **South Korea**, **Belgium**, **Denmark**, and **Spain**, contribute smaller numbers of hidden champions.

Moreover, between 2015 and 2020, the number of German hidden champions grew by one-fifth, and most of these are family firms that have existed for an average of 70 years. This information underscores Germanyâ€™s strong position in maintaining a robust ecosystem of globally competitive, lesser-known companies.
