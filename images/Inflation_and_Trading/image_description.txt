### Summary of Figure 6: Treatment Effects on Return Expectations by Perception Gaps

#### Chart Description:
This figure showcases the relationship between perception gaps in past DAX (German stock market index) returns during inflationary periods and the expected DAX return over the next 12 months. The data is segmented into four groups:
- **CG (Control Group)**: Receives no information.
- **T1**: Learns about the inflation environment.
- **T2**: Receives information on past asset returns during inflationary periods.
- **T3**: Receives information encompassing T1, T2, and additional explanations on past returns.

#### Findings:
- **Perception Gap**: The x-axis represents the perception gap in past DAX returns during inflationary periods, measured in percentage points (pp).
- **Expected DAX Return**: The y-axis tracks the expected DAX return over the next 12 months, expressed in percentage.

Negative perception gaps relate to higher pre-treatment inflationary-period return estimates, while more positive gaps indicate lower estimates.

#### Key Trends:
- Each treatment group's expected DAX returns decline as the perception gap in past returns grows more negative.
- The rate of decline varies across the treatment groups, with the control group (CG) showing the shallowest decline and T1 the steepest.
- This implies that informational treatments influence participants' return expectations by adjusting their perception of past returns during inflationary periods.

### Notes from the Chart:
- **Historical Context**: Returns are calculated since 1950, using realized annual returns of the German stock market in nominal terms during inflationary periods.
- **Inflationary Periods**: Defined as episodes in Germany where inflation accelerates past four percent.

The figure suggests that providing information about inflation (T1), asset returns during inflationary periods (T2), or comprehensive insights (T3) affects how individuals adjust their expectations based on their perception gaps.
