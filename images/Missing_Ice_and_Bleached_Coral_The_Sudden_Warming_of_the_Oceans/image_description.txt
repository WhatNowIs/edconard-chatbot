The image is a map depicting coral heat stress in the Caribbean region as of July 29. The map highlights various areas with different levels of heat stress measured in degrees Celsius-weeks (°C-weeks). The color scale ranges from blue (0 °C-weeks) to dark red (16 °C-weeks), where darker shades indicate higher levels of heat stress.

Key points:

1. **High Heat Stress Areas**: 
   - **Bahamas**: Significant areas, especially around the central and northern parts of the island, indicate high heat stress with deep red and orange colors.
   - **Cuba**: The southeastern coast shows considerable heat stress.
   - **Florida**: Parts of southern Florida are also experiencing elevated heat stress levels.

2. **Moderate to Low Heat Stress**:
   - The surrounding waters show varying degrees of heat stress with lighter shades indicating moderate stress.
   - Some regions show minimal to no heat stress (blue areas).

3. **Purpose**:
   - The map is sourced from Coral Reef Watch and is likely used to monitor and communicate the stress conditions of coral reefs in these regions.

This information is valuable for environmental monitoring, particularly for organizations involved in coral conservation, as it highlights areas under threat from rising sea temperatures.
