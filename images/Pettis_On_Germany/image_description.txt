The provided image is a line graph titled "German Output Has Trended Downward Since 2017 Peak." It depicts the industrial production index (with 2015 as the base year, set to 100) over time, from 1991 to 2023.

Key points from the graph:

1. **Historical Trend (1991-2017)**: German industrial output showed a general upward trend with fluctuations. Notable peaks and troughs occurred throughout this period, but the overall direction was an increase in industrial production until 2017.

2. **Peak and Decline (2017-Present)**: The industrial production index peaked around 2017. Since then, there has been a noticeable downward trend in output, with significant drops particularly evident around the 2020 period.

3. **Impact of 2020**: A sharp decline in the industrial production index occurred around 2020, likely corresponding to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The index dropped below 80 during this crisis.

4. **Recovery and Further Decline**: Following the 2020 dip, there was some recovery, but the output index has generally not returned to pre-2017 peak levels and continues to show a downward trend as of 2023.

5. **Index Values**: The highest index value was just above 105 (in 2017), and the lowest point during the observed period is around 70, occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This graph effectively illustrates the challenges faced by the German industrial sector since its peak in 2017, including significant disruptions around 2020, with partial recovery but continued decline in output.
