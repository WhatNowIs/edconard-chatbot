The chart, titled "Interest Costs Are Exploding," presents a projection of spending under the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) baseline from 2019 to 2033 in billions of dollars. The chart includes spending on Medicare, Defense, and Net Interest.

Key points from the chart:

- **Net Interest Costs:**
  - Net interest costs have been rising significantly and are projected to continue this steep upward trajectory.
  - By around 2025-2026, net interest costs are expected to surpass both Medicare and Defense spending.
  - A dashed line labeled "Net Interest (100bp above CBO)" suggests that if interest rates were 100 basis points higher than CBO's projections, the costs would increase even more steeply.
  - Net interest costs will hit a new record as a share of GDP within the projection period.

- **Medicare Spending:**
  - Medicare spending is projected to increase steadily from about $700 billion in 2019 to approximately $1,200 billion by 2033, maintaining a relatively linear growth.

- **Defense Spending:**
  - Defense spending is also increasing but at a slower rate compared to net interest and Medicare. It starts at around $600 billion in 2019 and goes up to around $900 billion by 2033.

The chart's data sources include the Congressional Budget Office and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, emphasizing the rising financial pressures from interest costs on the federal budget.
