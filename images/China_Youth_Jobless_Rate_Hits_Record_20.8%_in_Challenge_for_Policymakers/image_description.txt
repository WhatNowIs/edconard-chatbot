The image is a line graph titled "Topping Record Highs," displaying the urban unemployment rates in China from 2018 to 2023. It highlights two key unemployment rates: the youth urban unemployment rate (ages 16-24) and the urban unemployment rate nationwide.

Key observations:
- The black line represents the urban unemployment rate for ages 16-24, which has exhibited a noticeable increasing trend, particularly reaching a new record high in May 2023.
- The yellow line represents the nationwide urban unemployment rate, which has remained relatively stable over the same period.
- The youth unemployment rate reached close to 20% by 2023, significantly higher than the national rate.

Overall, the graph emphasizes that while the overall national unemployment rate has remained steady, the unemployment rate among youth has been increasing, reaching unprecedented levels in recent times.
