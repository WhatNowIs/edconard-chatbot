The graph, titled "The Next Collapsing Tech Cost: Software Itself," depicts the historical and projected cost trends of various technology components from 1960 to 2040. The data is represented in logarithmic scale on the y-axis, ranging from $0.01 to $1,000,000, and the timeline on the x-axis spans from 1960 to 2040. Four types of costs are illustrated:

1. **Storage ($/mb)**
   - Represented in orange, storage costs have dramatically decreased from over $1,000,000 per megabyte in 1960 to approaching zero near 2020.

2. **CPUs ($/MFLOP)**
   - Represented in gray, the cost of CPU processing power has similarly decreased from over $1,000,000 per MFLOP in 1960 to approaching zero around 2020.

3. **Bandwidth ($/MBPS)**
   - Represented in yellow, bandwidth costs have also dropped significantly from tens of thousands of dollars per Mbps in the early 2000s to nearing zero today.

4. **Software Engineers**
   - Represented in blue, the cost associated with software engineers has remained flat and high over the years but is projected to start declining steeply around 2020 and beyond.

The graph highlights how the costs for storage, CPUs, and bandwidth have plummeted over the decades. The red box outlines a key shift expected to occur post-2020, where it is anticipated that the cost of software development, particularly the cost of software engineers, will begin to collapse, following the trend of hardware and bandwidth costs. 

In summary, the chart conveys a significant expected decrease in the cost of software development driving a major shift in technological cost structures mirroring the historic declines seen in hardware and bandwidth expenses.
