The image is a line graph titled "Working It," illustrating changes in the Japanese population and employment dynamics for individuals aged 15-74 from 1978 to 2023, benchmarked to the 2000-2001 average (set at 100). The graph shows different lines representing four categories:
 
1. **Total (population)**: This dotted line starts above 100 in 2000-2001 and declines steadily thereafter to below 90 by 2023. 
2. **Total (employment)**: The solid blue line shows this category starting just above 90 in 2000-2001 and increasing to approximately 105 by 2023. 
3. **Males (population)**: This category, represented by a dotted red line, initially is slightly below 100 in 2000-2001, gradually decreasing to around 85 by 2023.
4. **Males (employment)**: This solid red line fluctuates around the benchmark, showing less significant change, ending close to 95 by 2023.
5. **Females (population)**: The dotted green line follows a similar trend to the total population, showing a steady decline from just above 95 in 2000-2001 to roughly 85 by 2023.
6. **Females (employment)**: This solid green line shows a notable increase from below 85 in 2000-2001 to over 110 by 2023.

Summary:
- Since the peak in 2000-2001, Japan's population aged 15-74 has dropped by 9%, but employment has increased by 3% due to a significant rise in female employment.
- Male population and employment have both declined slightly since 2000-2001.
- Female population has also decreased, but female employment shows a strong upward trend, surpassing the gains in the male employment rate.
  
This shift in employment patterns, particularly the surge in female employment, might serve as a model for other societies facing similar demographic challenges.
