The image presents a comparative analysis of real estate investment trends in China and the US from 2000 to 2023. Key points from the chart are:

1. **Real Estate Investment Levels**:
   - There is a significant rise in China's real estate investment in absolute terms (measured in billion dollars) over the period, peaking around 2014-2015.
   - The US real estate investment similarly shows growth but with notable fluctuations, particularly a sharp decline around 2008-2009, coinciding with the global financial crisis.

2. **Share of GDP**:
   - In China, real estate investment has consistently accounted for a larger share of GDP compared to the US. This share peaked around 2014 and has seen a downward trend since then.
   - The US real estate investment as a percentage of GDP has remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, significantly lower than that of China.

3. **Post-2015 Trends**:
   - After peaking in 2014-2015, both total real estate investment and its share of GDP have declined in China.
   - In contrast, the US has shown a more modest, stable level of real estate investment relative to GDP post-2009, with a slight declining trend noted in the most recent years (2022-2023).

4. **Economic Implications**:
   - The data suggests that the Chinese economy might be more susceptible to a real estate crisis given the larger proportion of GDP tied to real estate investment relative to the US.

Overall, the chart underscores the greater weight of real estate investments in Chinaâ€™s economy compared to the US, potentially making China more vulnerable to crises in the real estate sector.
