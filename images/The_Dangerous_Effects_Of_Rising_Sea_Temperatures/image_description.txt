The image presents data on the change in energy content in zetajoules across different Earth system components from 1960 to 2020. It illustrates how the ocean acts as a significant heat sink.

Key points:
1. **Oceans**: The majority of the heat is absorbed by the oceans, with significant storage occurring up to 2,000 meters deep. The graph shows a substantial increase in energy content starting around 1990, with a rapid rise continuing through 2020.
2. **Other Components (Land, Ice, Atmosphere)**: 
   - Only about 6% of the incoming heat is absorbed by the land.
   - The graph for land, ice, and the atmosphere shows a gradual increase in energy content compared to the oceans.
   - The included components are land (red), ice (white), and atmosphere (gray).

Overall, the data underscores the crucial role of the oceans in absorbing and storing the majority of incoming heat from Earth's climate system.
