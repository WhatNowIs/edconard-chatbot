The provided image is a map of the United States showcasing the "Zero-sum index" averaged by state. The color gradient ranges from light green to dark pink, representing the zero-sum index scale from 0.44 to 0.56.

Key Points:
1. The Zero-sum index is a metric likely to capture economic or social competition where one party's gain is another's loss.
2. States with lower zero-sum index values (more towards 0.44) are colored in green, indicating possibly less perceived competition.
3. States with higher zero-sum index values (closer to 0.56) are colored in pink, indicating higher perceived competition.

Highlights from the Map:
- Utah (UT), Vermont (VT), and Hawaii (HI) are among the states with the lowest zero-sum index values, colored in darker green.
- Massachusetts (MA), New Jersey (NJ), and Oklahoma (OK) are among the states with higher zero-sum index values, colored in darker pink.

This map helps visualize regional differences in perceptions of zero-sum thinking across the United States.
