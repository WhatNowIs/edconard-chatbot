The chart from the Pew Research Center illustrates the percentage of people, segmented by political party and ideology, who say they trust the government to do what is right just about always/most of the time. The data spans from the Nixon administration in the early 1970s to the Biden administration in the early 2020s. 

### Key Observations:

1. **General Trend:**
   - Trust in government has fluctuated significantly across all groups over the decades.
   - Generally, trust has been on a declining trend since the 1960s and 1970s.

2. **By Administration:**
   - **Nixon (1970s):** Trust begins relatively high but declines sharply.
   - **Reagan (1980s):** An increase in trust among Conservative and Moderate-Liberal Republicans.
   - **Clinton (1990s):** Increased trust, particularly among Democrats.
   - **Bush (2000s):** High trust among Republicans post-9/11; significant drop during the latter part of his term.

   - **Trump (2017-2020):** Sharp increase in trust among Republicans, distrust among Democrats.
   - **Biden (2021 onwards):** Trust levels among Democrats rise.

3. **Party & Ideology Specific:**

### Summary:
The trust in government fluctuates markedly along partisan and ideological lines, often reflecting the party of the sitting president. Republicans generally show higher trust during Republican presidencies and lower during Democratic ones, while Democrats exhibit the inverse trend. Overall, the trust has generally declined from the high points in the 1960s and 1970s, with notable exceptions during specific periods such as post-9/11 under George W. Bush and the early years of the Clinton and Obama presidencies.
