The chart displays the S&P 500 earnings yield premium over inflation-protected Treasuries from the early 2000s to 2023. This measure is calculated as the S&P 500 one-year forward earnings yield minus the yield on the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected security (TIPS). The y-axis represents this premium in percentage points (pct. pts).

Key observations from the chart include:
- The premium hovered around 4-6 percentage points through the mid-2000s.
- A substantial peak occurred around the 2008 financial crisis, with the premium rising sharply to about 10 percentage points.
- Post-2008, the premium saw fluctuations, with brief peaks and troughs.
- Since the mid-2010s, there has been a general downtrend, with the premium moving lower.
- By 2023, the premium appears to have declined significantly to around 3 percentage points, near its lowest point in the observed period.

This indicates that the relative attractiveness of S&P 500 earnings compared to inflation-protected Treasuries has diminished over recent years.
