**Summary of Exhibit 7:**
The exhibit illustrates a potential misalignment between the number of graduates in various disciplines and the hiring demands of businesses. The size of each bubble corresponds to the number of graduates within each discipline.

1. **Axes:**
   - **X-Axis:** Enterprise hiring demand diffusion index change (2018 vs. 2021).
   - **Y-Axis:** Change in the number of graduates in higher education institutions by discipline (2018 vs. 2021).

2. **Key Insights:**
   - **Transport and Communication** and **Education and Sport** have a high increase in graduates but a relatively low or negative hiring demand.
   - **Civil Engineering and Architecture** shows a high number of graduates but negative hiring demand.
   - **IT** graduates have seen moderate growth, with reasonable alignment with hiring demand.
   - **Equipment Manufacturing** has a high hiring demand growth but fewer corresponding graduate increases.
   - Fields like **Medicine and Health Care** show some alignment but less prominent.
   - Sectors like **Finance and Economics** exhibit moderate changes in both graduates and hiring demand but are distributed around the origin.

3. **Regression Analysis:**
   - The negative slope of the regression line (\(y = -2.95x + 16.80\)) indicates an overall trend where an increase in the hiring demand does not necessarily correlate with an increase in the number of graduates.
   - The RÂ² value of 0.12 suggests a weak correlation between the number of graduates by discipline and the hiring demand changes.

Overall, the exhibit points out that there are mismatches between graduate outputs in higher education and market hiring needs, which could imply a need for better alignment between educational disciplines and industry requirements.
