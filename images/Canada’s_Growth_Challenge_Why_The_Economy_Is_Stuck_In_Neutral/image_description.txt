The chart illustrates the contribution of different factors to the growth in Canadian GDP per hour worked over five time periods (1969-79, 1979-89, 1989-99, 1999-09, and 2009-22). 

The factors contributing to labor productivity growth are:

1. **Contribution of capital intensity:** Represented by dark blue bars.
2. **Contribution of labor composition:** Represented by light blue bars.
3. **Multifactor productivity:** Represented by orange bars.

### Summary:

- **1969-79:** The highest growth in GDP per hour worked is observed, with significant contributions from all three factors. Capital intensity and multifactor productivity especially played major roles.

- **1979-89:** There was a decrease in the overall growth rate compared to the previous decade, but all three factors continued to contribute positively, albeit at a reduced level.

- **1989-99:** The contributions from capital intensity and multifactor productivity saw a modest increase compared to 1979-89, leading to an overall growth rate similar to the 1969-79 period.

- **1999-09:** Multifactor productivity shows a significant negative impact, although contributions from capital intensity and labor composition remained positive.

- **2009-22:** Marked by the least growth in GDP per hour worked. Contributions from capital intensity were nearly negligible, with multifactor productivity and labor composition providing minimal positive contributions.

The chart effectively highlights the trend of diminishing capital intensity contributions over time and outlines multifactor productivity as a critical influence; notably, it had a negative impact during 1999-09, stressing the importance of multifactor productivity and investment to drive labor productivity growth in Canada.
