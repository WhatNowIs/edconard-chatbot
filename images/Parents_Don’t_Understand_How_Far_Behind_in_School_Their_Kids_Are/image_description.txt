The chart illustrates changes in math scores across various school districts from 2019 to 2022, plotting districts based on their socioeconomic status, ranging from poorer to richer districts. 

Key takeaways:
1. **Overall Decline**: By 2022, the average math score for a typical district dropped by half a year.
2. **Socioeconomic Disparity**:
   - **Poorest Districts**: In the poorest districts, scores fell by three-quarters of a year.
   - **Richest Districts**: In the richest districts, the decline was less steep, with scores falling by three-eighths of a year.
3. **Specific Example**: The Wentzville R-IV, Mo. district saw its students fall behind by 0.7 years by 2022.
4. **Baseline Reference**: The graph uses the 2019 average as a reference point, denoting areas where students were ahead or behind by up to four years, both before and after the decline.

The data suggests that while all districts experienced a decline in math scores, the impact was more severe in poorer districts compared to richer ones.
