The image provides a set of four scatter plot graphs, each illustrating the correlation of health, education, and fertility rates in India. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **India 1995-2019 (Top-Left Graph)**
   - This graph shows a strong positive correlation (R=0.99) between the total fertility rate (births per woman) and a variable measured on the X-axis, which appears to cover a range of years from 20 to 80.

2. **Longitudinal (Top-Right Graph)**
   - This graph indicates a strong negative correlation (R=-0.99) between the total fertility rate and another variable (possibly education or time) with values ranging from 4 to 7 on the X-axis.

3. **India's States 2017-19 (Bottom-Left Graph)**
   - This graph illustrates a moderate positive correlation (R=0.64) between the total fertility rate and the infant mortality rate (deaths per 1000 live births). Higher infant mortality rates are associated with higher fertility rates.

4. **Horizontal (Bottom-Right Graph)**
   - This graph shows a moderate negative correlation (R=-0.52) between the total fertility rate and the mean years of education of adults aged 20 and above. Higher education levels are associated with lower fertility rates.

Overall, these graphs suggest that in India, factors such as infant mortality rate and educational attainment significantly influence fertility rates. High infant mortality rates are correlated with higher fertility rates, whereas higher levels of education are correlated with lower fertility rates.
