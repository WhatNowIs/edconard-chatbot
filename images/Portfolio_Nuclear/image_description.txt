The image is a bar chart illustrating the US Energy Balance Sheet, specifically focusing on net exported energy as a percentage of total US energy consumption from 2005 to Q1 2023.

Key details of the chart include:

1. **Time Frame**:
   - The data spans from 2005 through 2022, with an estimate for Q1 2023.

2. **Net Exported Energy Trends**:
   - From 2005 to 2007, the US had a negative net export percentage, at around -30.2% indicating significant energy imports.
   - The negative percentage decreased gradually, bottoming out at -22.2% in 2008.
   - From 2008 onwards, the negative value progressively reduced, reaching -11.2% in 2016.
   - Between 2017 and 2019, the net export percentage hovered around zero, indicating a more balanced energy import-export ratio.
   - By 2020, the US shifted to a net positive energy export, standing at approximately 3.7%.
   - In 2021, the net positive export increased further to around 5.9%.
   - The estimate for Q1 2023 continues this positive trend, but the exact percentage is not stated.

3. **Source and Estimation**:
   - The data is sourced from eia.gov.
   - The chart and estimation are attributed to "the gregor letter."

**Summary**:
From 2005 to Q1 2023, the United States has gradually decreased its dependency on energy imports, transitioning from a significant net energy importer status (-30.2% in 2005) to becoming a net energy exporter in recent years (5.9% in 2021), with ongoing positive estimates for early 2023.
