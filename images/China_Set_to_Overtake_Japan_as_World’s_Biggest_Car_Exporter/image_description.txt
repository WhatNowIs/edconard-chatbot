The chart titled "China poised to export more cars than Japan in 2023" illustrates the monthly car exports (in units) on a 12-month moving average basis for China, Japan, Germany, and South Korea from 2019 to 2023. Here are the key points:

1. **Trend Overview**: 
   - China’s car exports have been increasing rapidly since mid-2022 and have surpassed Japan’s exports in early 2023.
   - Japan’s car exports have been relatively stable but started to decline slightly in 2022 before plateauing.
   - Germany’s and South Korea’s car exports have remained relatively steady over the entire period, with Germany exporting more than South Korea.

2. **China's Rapid Growth**:
   - Starting at less than 100,000 units in 2019, China’s car exports grew steadily until 2021, experienced a brief plateau, and then increased sharply from 2022 onward.
   - By 2023, China’s monthly car exports have reached well over 300,000 units, overtaking Japan.

3. **Japan’s Exports**:
   - Japan started with monthly exports of around 400,000 units in 2019 but saw a decline in 2020. 
   - Exports plateaued between 300,000 and 350,000 units from 2021 to early 2023 before China overtook Japan.

4. **Germany and South Korea**:
   - Germany’s monthly car exports have remained around 150,000 to 200,000 units.
   - South Korea’s exports have hovered around 200,000 units throughout the period.

5. **Summary**: 
   The data shows that China is on a trajectory to surpass Japan as the world's leading car exporter in 2023, thanks to a significant increase in car exports starting in mid-2022. Meanwhile, Japan, Germany, and South Korea have exhibited relatively stable export trends with no significant growth comparable to China's surge.
