The provided graph depicts the standard deviations from average values over a specific time period, ranging from January 1, 2018, to November 30, 2022. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Initial Stability (Jan 2018 - Late 2019):** 
   - The standard deviations hovered around the average value (zero line), indicating a stable period with minimal fluctuation.

2. **Increase in Variability (Late 2019 - Mid 2020):** 
   - There was a significant increase in variability starting around late 2019, with standard deviations rising above the average.

3. **Fluctuations (Mid 2020 - Mid 2021):**
   - This period saw multiple peaks, with deviations consistently staying above the average, indicating greater variability and fluctuations.

4. **Peak and Decline (Mid 2021 - Mid 2022):**
   - Around mid-2021, the graph shows the highest peak in standard deviations, followed by a gradual decline towards the mid of 2022.

5. **Recent Downtrend (Mid 2022 - Nov 2022):**
   - The values showed a declining trend towards the end of the period, still above the average but trending downward.

### Summary:
The data indicates that from January 2018 to November 2022, the values remained mostly stable until late 2019, after which there was a marked increase in variability with significant peaks observed during mid-2021. Post mid-2021, the deviations began to decline towards the end of the period, although they remained above the average value. This pattern suggests periods of heightened volatility followed by a trend toward stabilization.
