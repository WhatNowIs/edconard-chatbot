The image shows two line graphs comparing the top 1% shares of national income over time, using different data series (PSZ and Auten-Splinter). 

1. **Graph A: Pre-tax national income: Top 1% share**
   - This graph tracks the share of pre-tax national income held by the top 1% from 1960 to 2020.
   - The PSZ series (blue line) shows a general upward trend, peaking around 2010 and slightly declining thereafter.
   - The Auten-Splinter series (red line) also shows an upward trend but remains consistently lower than the PSZ series.
   - The Piketty-Saez series (dashed gray line) appears as a middle ground between the PSZ and Auten-Splinter series.

2. **Graph B: After-tax national income: Top 1% share**
   - This graph shows the share of after-tax national income held by the top 1% over the same period.
   - Both the PSZ and Auten-Splinter series exhibit similar trends to the pre-tax graph, but the top 1% shares are generally lower after accounting for taxes.
   - The PSZ series continues to show a higher income share for the top 1% compared to the Auten-Splinter series.

**Figure 6 Summary:**
The figure presents a comparison of the top 1% shares of national income using two different series (PSZ and Auten-Splinter). The PSZ series indicates higher shares of income for the top 1% both pre-tax and after-tax compared to the Auten-Splinter series. Both series show an increasing trend in income concentration among the top 1% from 1960 to 2020, with a noticeable peak around 2010. The differences highlight variations in data handling and assumptions used by the different series.
