The image provided depicts a graph comparing population projections (in millions) for India, the USA, and China from the year 1950 to 2100. The graph includes several projections from different years and different fertility rates for China. Here is a summary of the information:

### Key Information:

- **Population axis (y-axis)**: Measures the population in millions.
- **Time axis (x-axis)**: Extends from 1950 to 2100.
- **Different Projections and Rates**:
  - **India (WPP-2022)**: Population is projected to continue to rise past 2022.
  - **USA (WPP-2022)**: Population shows a steady increase over the years.
  - **China**:
    - **Historical and multiple World Population Projections (WPP)** from 1992, 1996, 2000, and 2019. These projections show the population reaching a peak around 2020 to 2030 and then declining.
    - **Yi TFR (Total Fertility Rate) scenarios**: 
      - With TFR = 1.1: The population declines significantly after 2030.
      - With TFR = 0.8: The population declines even more steeply, indicating a faster reduction in numbers.

### Summary:

The graph showcases historical population data and future projections for India, the USA, and China. India's population is projected to continue its rise, potentially surpassing other nations. The USA's population shows a steady but less sharp increase. In contrast, China's population is projected to peak around 2030 and then decline, with variations based on different fertility rate scenarios. With a TFR of 1.1 or 0.8, the decline in China's population is more pronounced. Different World Population Projections (WPP) emphasize this trend with slight variations in the speed and extent of population decline.
