The image is a graph titled "Home Equity Extraction during Pandemic Refi Boom: Aggregate equity extraction." It measures the amount of equity extracted from refinances in billions of U.S. dollars and as a percent of disposable personal income (dpi) from March 2000 to 2023.

Key points from the graph include:

- The data covers from March 2000 to early 2023.
- Equity extraction from refinances (in billions of U.S. dollars) is indicated by the blue line, with the scale on the left axis.
- Equity extraction as a percent of dpi is represented by the red line, with the scale on the right axis.

Observations:
- There was a substantial rise in both the amount of equity extracted and its percent of dpi during the early 2000s, peaking around 2005-2006.
- Both measures declined significantly following the 2008 financial crisis, reaching a low around 2011-2012.
- A gradual recovery is seen starting around 2012, with notable spikes beginning in 2020 and peaking around 2021-2022 before declining again in 2023.
