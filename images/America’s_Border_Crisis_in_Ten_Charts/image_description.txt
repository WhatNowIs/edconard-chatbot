The chart titled "Illegal immigration" presented by The Economist provides data on monthly encounters at the south-west land border of the United States from 2000 to 2023. The data is categorized into different time periods corresponding to the U.S. presidential terms of Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden. The y-axis indicates the number of encounters (in thousands), with a scale from 0 to 250. 

### Key Points:
1. **Bush Administration (2000-2008)**:
   - A significant decline in encounters is observed, starting from a high of nearly 200,000 monthly encounters in early 2000 to about 50,000 by the end of 2008.

2. **Obama Administration (2009-2017)**:
   - Encounters remained relatively low, averaging around 50,000, with slight fluctuations but overall stability throughout the tenure.

3. **Trump Administration (2017-2021)**:
   - There is volatility in the number of encounters, including a notable spike reaching approximately 100,000 monthly in 2019.

4. **Biden Administration (2021-present)**
   - Encounters have significantly increased, with peaks nearing 200,000 monthly, indicating an upward trend since the beginning of this term.

5. **12-month Moving Average**:
   - The chart includes a 12-month moving average, which smooths out the short-term fluctuations to show long-term trends. This line confirms the downward trend in the Bush era, stability in the Obama era, volatility during Trump's term, and an upward trend during Biden's term.

### Additional Notes:
- The chart specifies that since March 2020, the monthly totals include both apprehensions and expulsions, whereas prior totals included apprehensions only.

### Summary:
The data reveals a fluctuating trend in illegal immigration encounters at the U.S. south-west border over the past two decades, with distinct patterns during each presidential administration. The encounters decreased significantly during the Bush era, remained stable during Obama's tenure, showed volatility during Trump's term, and have increased notably under the Biden administration, with recent months seeing some of the highest encounter rates.
