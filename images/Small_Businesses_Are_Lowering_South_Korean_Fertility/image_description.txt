The image presents a bar chart titled "Figure 1. Job Distribution in OECD Countries: SMEs (1â€“249 Employees) and Large Enterprises (250+ Employees)." It displays the proportion of jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) versus large enterprises across various OECD countries.

Key observations:
- South Korea has the highest percentage of SME employment, nearing 80%.
- The United States has the highest percentage of large enterprise employment, approximately 50%.
- Many countries, including Greece, Estonia, Portugal, and Turkey, have over 70% of employment in SMEs.
- The majority of OECD countries have over half of their employment in SMEs, with the remaining distribution in large enterprises.
- Countries like Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States show a more balanced distribution between SME and large enterprise employment.

The chart uses two colors: orange for SMEs (1-249 employees) and blue for large enterprises (250+ employees), easily distinguishing the proportions of job distribution among these categories. It indicates a general trend where SMEs play a crucial role in providing employment, especially in certain countries, while large enterprises dominate employment in others.
