### Summary:

The graph titled "12-Month Ahead Recession Probabilities Derived from Yield Spreads" from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis illustrates the probability of a recession occurring within the next 12 months, based on the yield spreads between ten-year and three-month Treasury securities, both in real and nominal terms. The data spans from 1959 to 2023, with shaded areas indicating periods of recession as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER).

#### Key Points:

1. **Probability Trend**:
    - The graph displays two lines representing recession probabilities:
      - **Solid Blue Line**: Ten-Year-Three-Month Yield Spread in Real Terms.
      - **Dashed Orange Line**: Ten-Year-Three-Month Yield Spread in Nominal Terms.
    - Over the years, the probability of a recession tends to spike prior to actual recessions, which are shaded in gray.

2. **Historical Peaks**:
    - Notable peaks in the probability of recession often precede recessions, with significant spikes observed before the recessions of the mid-1970s, early 1980s, early 1990s, early 2000s, the Great Recession of 2007-2009, and the COVID-19 recession in 2020.

3. **Recent Trends**:
    - As of 2023, both real and nominal yield spreads indicate an elevated probability of an upcoming recession, nearing the peaks observed in previous pre-recession periods.

4. **Sources**:
    - The data is sourced from several authoritative institutions including FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data), Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the Livingston Survey, and the author's calculations.

5. **Notes**:
    - The shaded gray areas represent official NBER recession periods, helping correlate yield spread predictions with actual economic downturns.

This visualization underscores the predictive power of yield spreads in forecasting economic recessions and highlights significant historical economic trends leading up to periods of economic contraction.
