The image is a graph depicting the relative labor force participation rates (LFPRs) of prime-age males and females in the United States from 2013 to 2023, with 2019 serving as the baseline (indexed at 100). 

Key takeaways from the graph:

1. **Periods Covered**: The graph spans from early 2013 to mid-2023.
2. **Two Data Series**:
   - **Males (Blue Line)**: Represents the activity rate for males aged 25-54.
   - **Females (Red Line)**: Represents the activity rate for females aged 25-54.
3. **2019 Baseline**: Both male and female activity rates are indexed to 100 for the year 2019.
4. **Trends**:
   - From 2013 to 2019, the relative LFPR for males showed minor fluctuations but remained relatively stable around the baseline.
   - For the same period, the female LFPR experienced small declines but remained close to the baseline.
   - Post-2019, both male and female LFPRs show more significant movements. There is a noticeable dip for both genders around 2020, likely corresponding to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - Post-pandemic, the female LFPR picked up sharply, surpassing the baseline significantly, while the male LFPR also increased but remained relatively closer to the baseline.

The graph highlights that over the past decade, while male LFPR has experienced some fluctuations, the female LFPR has shown significant growth since the pandemic, indicating a rising involvement of prime-age women in the labor force in recent years.
