The image represents Germany's trade balance as a percentage of GDP from 1971 to the present. The data in the chart shows the following key points:

1. **Early Years (1971-1980s)**: There is significant fluctuation, with the trade balance ranging mostly between 2% and 5%. Occasional drops below 0% can be observed in this period.

2. **Late 1980s to Early 1990s**: The trade balance stabilizes somewhat around 2-4%, though there are still frequent fluctuations.

3. **Mid-1990s to Early 2000s**: The trade balance shows growth, consistently moving above 4% and peaking near 8% around the turn of the millennium.

4. **2000s**: A volatile period with sharp declines and rises. There's a notable drop around 2008-2009 coinciding with the global financial crisis, but it recovers quickly.

5. **2010s to 2020**: The trade balance stays high, hovering mostly between 6% and 8%, indicating a strong trade surplus.

6. **Recent Trends (2020-2023)**: A sharp decline is observed around the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, dropping below 0% again. However, there is a significant and rapid recovery post-pandemic, with a recent upward trajectory approaching 6%.

**Summary**: Over the past five decades, Germany's trade balance as a percentage of GDP has experienced significant volatility but demonstrates a clear upward trajectory since the early 1990s. Despite short-term drops, Germany maintains a strong trade surplus, particularly noticeable from the early 2000s onward. Recent years have seen dramatic shifts due to global events like the COVID-19 pandemic, but the trade balance is rebounding strongly.
