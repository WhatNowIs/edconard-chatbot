The image is a political cartoon featuring two distinct characters representing different entities. On the left, there is a relaxed character sitting in a deckchair, with a brimmed hat and a drink in one hand and a cigar in the other. The deckchair has the European Union (EU) flag on its backrest, signified by the circle of yellow stars on a blue background. This character symbolizes the EU, depicting it in a leisurely, passive state.

On the right, there is a character resembling Uncle Sam, who is often used to represent the United States. This character is depicted in action, walking assertively while holding a large wrench over his shoulder and a toolbox in his left hand. The toolbox has an iconic poster on the side, which reads "We Can Do It!" symbolizing a proactive and industrious attitude.

The cartoon contrasts the EU's relaxed, possibly complacent stance with the U.S.'s active and industrious approach, potentially commenting on the differing attitudes or roles each entity plays in a global or political context.
