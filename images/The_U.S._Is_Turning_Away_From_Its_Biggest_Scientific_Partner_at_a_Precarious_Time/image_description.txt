The chart titled "United States of Collaboration" highlights the extent to which the U.S. relies on research partnerships with China and other international collaborators across various strategic areas. The data spans from 2018 to 2022, sourced from Clarivate.

### Key Insights:

1. **Research Areas with High U.S.-China Collaboration**:
   - **Telecom**: Approximately 30% of U.S. papers are collaborative efforts with China.
   - **Nanoscience/tech.**: About 25-30% of papers result from collaborations with China.
   - **Electrical/electronic engineering**: Roughly 25-30% involve partnerships with China.
   - **Fuel & energy**: Around 25% of the research papers are co-authored with China.
   - **Materials/Ceramics**: Also has a significant portion (approx. 25%) of collaborative papers with China.

2. **Research Areas with Lower U.S.-China Collaboration**:
   - **Cell biology**: Less reliance on China, with less than 20% of papers produced in collaboration.
   - **Biochemistry/Molecular biology**: Similar to cell biology, less than 20% of papers are joint efforts with China.
   - **Zoology**: Only a small percentage of papers (around 10-15%) involve collaborations with China.
   - **Healthcare sciences**: Very few papers (less than 10%) are collaboratively produced with China.

3. **General Collaboration Trends**:
   - Across all research fields combined, around 15-20% of U.S. papers are produced in collaboration with China.
   - Other international collaborations also play a significant role, especially notable in combined research categories.
   - U.S. only produced papers dominate in all fields, indicating a strong independent research capability.

The summary showcases that while the U.S. has strong collaborative ties with China in specific domains like telecom and materials science, in areas such as healthcare and zoology, more papers are produced domestically or with other international partners.
