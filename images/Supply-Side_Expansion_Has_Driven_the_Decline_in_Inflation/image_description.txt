The chart in "Figure 3: Inflation Deceleration Is Driven by Expanded Supply, 123 Core PCE Categories" illustrates the relationship between changes in price (inflation) and changes in quantity (real value) for approximately 123 Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) categories. The chart compares the 6-month change from July 2023 to December 2022.

Key observations from the chart include:
1. The horizontal axis shows the percentage point change in quantity (real value), ranging from around -20% to 20%.
2. The vertical axis depicts the percentage point change in price (inflation), ranging from around -10% to 10%.
3. The chart is divided into four quadrants, with the goods categories on the left side and the services categories on the right.
4. Most points are clustered around 0% change in both price and quantity, indicating stable conditions for the majority of categories.
5. In the goods quadrant, several categories experienced an increase in price with a corresponding decrease in quantity.
6. In the services quadrant, a few categories show a significant price rise with minimal change in quantity.

Overall, the chart suggests that the deceleration of inflation is largely attributed to supply expansions across various core PCE categories, with notable differences between goods and services.
