The graph titled "From boomers to bust" presents the fertility rates (births per woman) by region from 1950 to 2050, with the last part being a forecast. The regions covered include Asia, Africa, Oceania, Latin America, North America, and Europe. 

Key observations:
- The replacement rate, marked by a dashed red line, is 2.1 births per woman.
- Historically, Africa has had the highest fertility rates among the regions, starting near 7-8 births per woman in 1950, but shows a steep decline, although it remains above other regions.
- Asia's fertility rate was also quite high in 1950 but has fallen significantly since then.
- Latin America, Oceania, and North America displayed moderate fertility rates initially but have all seen declines converging towards the replacement rate of 2.1.
- Europe's fertility rates have been the lowest throughout the period and dropped below the replacement rate quite early on.
- Forecasts from present day to 2050 indicate a continued decline or stabilization near or below the replacement rate for most regions.

Overall, the global trend indicates a significant decline in fertility rates across all regions, moving towards or remaining below the replacement rate of 2.1 births per woman.
