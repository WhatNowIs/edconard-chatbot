The graph, titled "Figure B.1: Actual and Counterfactual Quarterly ZIP Code Moving Hazards," illustrates the mobility rates and counterfactual mobility rates over time, starting from the first quarter of 2018 through the first quarter of 2023. The y-axis measures the mobility rate, while the x-axis represents the time period in quarters.

Key points to note:
1. Two lines are plotted on the graph:
   - The solid line represents the actual mobility rate.
   - The dashed line represents the counterfactual mobility rate.
   
2. The mobility rate fluctuates throughout the period, with notable peaks and troughs:
   - There is a significant peak around early 2018, followed by a decrease.
   - Subsequent upswings and downswings are observable throughout each year.

3. The actual and counterfactual mobility rates appear closely aligned throughout the observed period, with both following a similar pattern of changes.

4. The source of the data is from the University of California (UC-CCP).

5. The notes mention:
   - Counterfactual moving rates are estimated using the preferred OLS model (referenced in Table 2, row 1, column 3).
   - When a positive rate gap is present, counterfactual rates are set to zero as discussed in section 5.3.

The graph visually depicts how actual mobility rates compare to estimated counterfactual mobility rates over several years, indicating trends and deviations in ZIP code mobility hazards.
