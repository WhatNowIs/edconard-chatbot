The chart titled "Normalization?" examines U.S. labor market conditions from 2001 through 2023, presenting various z-score measures:

1. **Private-sector workers quitting their jobs (% of employed):** This metric is represented by blue lines and shows how the quit rate has fluctuated over the years. Significant increases are visible post-2020, indicating higher labor market churn.
  
2. **Private-sector posted job openings (% of employed):** Indicated by red lines, this metric demonstrates the percentage of job openings. It shows a steep rise post-2015, peaking around 2022 before slightly decreasing.
  
3. **Median yearly change in hourly wage of employed workers:** Represented by green lines, this measure of wage growth correlates with periods of high job openings and quit rates.
  
4. **Yearly change in private-sector wages and salaries (ECI):** The purple lines trace changes in wages, generally following the trends of job openings and quits.

The chart shows a significant increase in all metrics post-2020, possibly due to economic impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, there appears to be a stabilization or slight decline in job openings and quit rates, suggesting potential normalization.

The data sources include the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and calculations by Matthew Klein. The overall narrative suggests that as worker pay surged, labor market churn increased. Now, as job openings and quit rates start to decrease, these trends might impact wage growth measured by the Atlanta Fed.
