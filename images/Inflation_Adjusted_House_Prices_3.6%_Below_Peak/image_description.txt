The chart titled "Real House Prices" displays the Case-Shiller National Home Price Index (in blue) and the Case-Shiller Composite-20 Home Price Index (in red), both of which are adjusted for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (excluding shelter). The y-axis represents the index values, and the x-axis denotes the time period from January 1976 to January 2024. The chart highlights periods of recession with shaded blue bars.

Key Points:
1. **Historical Trends**: 
   - From the late 1970s to the late 1990s, both indices remained relatively stable around or below the baseline index value of 100.
   - In the early 2000s, both indices began a steep climb, peaking just before the financial crisis.

2. **Housing Bubble and Crash**: 
   - Both indices reached a peak around 2006-2007, with index values approaching 190.
   - Following the peak, there was a significant decline during the financial crisis of 2008-2009, with index values dropping below 130.

3. **Post-Crisis Recovery**:
   - From 2012 onwards, there was a gradual recovery in real house prices.
   - Around 2020, the indices once again began to rise sharply.

4. **Recent Trends**: 
   - By 2022, the indices reached a new peak, surpassing the previous high from 2006-2007.
   - There is a slight downward trend observed towards the end of the chart (early 2023).

5. **Recession Periods**:
   - The chart marks several recession periods where house prices typically see either stagnation or decline, evident in the shaded regions.

In summary, the data reveals that real house prices have experienced notable fluctuations over the past several decades, characterized by significant peaks before the financial crises and subsequent recoveries. The recent data indicates another sharp increase in house prices post-2020, with a slight correction noted in early 2023.
