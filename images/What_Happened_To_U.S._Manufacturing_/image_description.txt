The image is a graph titled "Figure 4: Chinese import competition accelerates after 2000 and then returns to trend" which depicts Chinese import penetration in U.S. manufacturing from 1990 to 2020.

- **Trends Represented:**
  - **1990-2000 Trend (Orange Dashes):** A lower and steadier increase in Chinese import penetration.
  - **2000-2010 Trend (Light Blue Dashes):** A steeper increase showing accelerated Chinese import penetration during this period.
  - **2010-2018 Trend (Purple Dashes):** A more moderate increase, returning closer to the trend observed pre-2000.

- **Key Observations:**
  - From 1990 to 2000, the import penetration increased gradually.
  - Significant acceleration in Chinese import penetration occurred between 2000 and 2010.
  - Post-2010, the trend returned to a steadier growth rate similar to the pre-2000 period.
  - Around 2020, there was a notable dip in the import penetration trend.

- **Data Description:**
  - The graph captures Chinese manufacturing imports as a percentage of total U.S. manufacturing gross output, defined as imports divided by the sum of gross output plus imports minus exports.
  - Data sources include the Bureau of Economic Analysis for manufacturing gross output, and the U.S. International Trade Commission Dataweb for import and export data.

- **Source:**
  - The calculations are based on adaptations from Bloom et al. (2024).

This graph is useful for understanding how Chinese competition in the U.S. manufacturing sector has evolved over three decades, indicating significant shifts particularly in the early 2000s.
