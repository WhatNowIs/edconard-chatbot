The image is a line graph (Figure 2) illustrating aggregate personal savings versus the pre-pandemic trend from 2016 to 2022. The key points are:

1. **Personal Savings (in $ billions)**: The y-axis represents personal savings in billions of dollars, and the x-axis covers years from 2016 to 2022.
   
2. **Pre-Pandemic Trend**: This is depicted as a dashed blue line, indicating an expected path for personal savings based on data for the 48 months leading up to the first month of the 2020 recession (as defined by the NBER).

3. **Pandemic Effect**: There is a significant spike in personal savings during the 2020 pandemic period, resulting in accumulated excess savings, marked in green, reaching up to $2.1 trillion.

4. **Drawdowns of Excess Savings**: Post the peak, there's a decline shown in red, indicating the drawdowns of excess savings amounting to $1.6 trillion.

5. **Savings Trends**: Before the pandemic, savings were relatively stable, hovering around the pre-pandemic trend line. During the pandemic, savings drastically increased, followed by a marked decline or drawdown in savings afterward.

**Summary**:
This figure provides an overview of how personal savings deviated significantly from the pre-pandemic trend due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Personal savings saw an unprecedented increase up to $2.1 trillion in excess savings during the pandemic, but subsequently experienced a reduction as individuals drew down these excess savings, amounting to $1.6 trillion. This analysis highlights the sharp fluctuations in personal savings driven by the economic conditions brought on by the pandemic.
