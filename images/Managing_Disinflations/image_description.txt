The image contains three distinct line graphs projected from 2021 to 2025, focusing on core PCE inflation, the unemployment rate, and policy rates. Each graph compares two distinct scenarios: a "Full Historical Period" (red) and a "Stable Inflation Period" (blue). Key takeaways from each graph are shown below:

### A. Core PCE Inflation (4 Quarter Change):
1. **Historical Trend (2021-2022)**:
   - Inflation rises sharply from 1% to approximately 5.5%.
2. **Projections (2023-2025)**:
   - Full Historical Period: Inflation is expected to remain moderately high around 4.5% in 2023, gradually declining to about 3% by 2025.
   - Stable Inflation Period: Inflation is projected to fall more steeply, reaching below 2% by 2025.

### B. Unemployment Rate:
1. **Historical Trend (2021-2022)**:
   - The unemployment rate declines steadily from around 7% to about 4%.
2. **Projections (2023-2025)**:
   - Full Historical Period: Unemployment is expected to gradually increase towards 5% by 2025.
   - Stable Inflation Period: Unemployment also increases, but to a lesser extent, stabilizing slightly above 4% by 2025.

### C. Policy Rate:
1. **Historical Trend (2021-2022)**:
   - Policy rates increase sharply from near-zero to about 5%.
2. **Projections (2023-2025)**:
   - Full Historical Period: Policy rates are projected to remain elevated around 4.5% in 2023, with a gradual decline to around 3.5% by 2025.
   - Stable Inflation Period: Policy rates show a sharper decline and are projected to stabilize closer to 2% by 2025.

### Overall Summary:
- **Core PCE Inflation** is expected to decline from its peak, with a sharper decline in a stable inflation period.
- **Unemployment Rates** are likely to increase slightly, reflecting slower economic growth, especially under historical conditions.
- **Policy Rates** are expected to decrease from their peaks, with a larger reduction in a stable inflation period.

These projections suggest that monetary policies will be crucial in navigating the economic landscape and managing inflation and unemployment levels effectively. The note summarizes that these simulations are based on a sample ending in 2022, considering the median and interquartile ranges from 10,000 draws.
