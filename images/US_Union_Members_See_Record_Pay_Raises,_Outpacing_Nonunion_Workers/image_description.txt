The image presents a line chart comparing the annual wage gains for private sector union workers and non-union workers from 2001 to a projected 2024. The key insights from the chart are as follows:

- **Overall Trend**: Union workers' wages (black line) have seen a significant surge, especially in recent years, reaching a record high around 2023-2024. Non-union workers' wages (pink line) have also increased but at a slower rate than union workers.

- **Union Wage Gains**:
  - Early 2000s (2001-2003): Union wage gains started high but then declined.
  - 2004-2020: Experienced several ups and downs but generally oscillated between 1% to 3%.
  - Post-2020: Showed a noticeable upward trajectory, peaking around 6.0% by 2024.

- **Non-union Wage Gains**:
  - Early 2000s: Experienced a steady decline, bottoming out around 2004-2005.
  - Mid 2000s-2019: Saw fluctuations with peaks in 2006-2007, 2015, and another dip in 2010.
  - 2020 onwards: Experienced a significant rise and eventual peak around 2022 but then showed a decline leading up to 2024.

The data, sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, indicates a substantial divergence between union and non-union wage growth in recent years, with union wages outpacing non-union wages more significantly as time progresses. This surge demonstrates a recent trend toward stronger wage gains for union workers in the private sector.
