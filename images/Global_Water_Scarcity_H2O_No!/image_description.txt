The image provides an illustration of the regional variation in drought risk across the United States, based on data from 1895 to 2020. The drought frequency is measured as the number of years per decade in which at least one summer month (June, July, or August) experienced moderate to extreme drought severity, defined by a Palmer Modified Drought Index (PMDI) of -2 or less. 

The map color-codes regions by the frequency of drought years per decade:
- Blue areas represent regions with 1-2 years of drought per decade.
- Green areas represent regions with 2-3 years of drought per decade.
- Yellow areas represent regions with 3-4 years of drought per decade.
- Red areas represent regions with 4-5 years of drought per decade.

Key observations include:
- The southwestern United States, particularly southern California and parts of Arizona, exhibit the highest drought frequency, with 4-5 years of moderate to extreme drought per decade.
- Some parts of the Great Plains and southeastern US have a moderate drought frequency (3-4 years per decade).
- The central and northeastern regions experience lower drought frequencies, predominantly 1-2 years per decade.
