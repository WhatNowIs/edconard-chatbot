The image consists of Figure 6, which illustrates "Effects of Capital-Embodied Technological Change on the Labor Share" for the period from 1990 to 2018. 

The figure has two panels:
(a) Software Contribution
(b) Equipment Contribution

Each panel depicts how different factors contributed to the overall change in labor share over time. The relevant contributing factors are:
- "w/in Substitution" (within substitution)
- "b/w Substitution" (between substitution)
- "Markup"
- "Overall" (combined effect)

A few key points from the visualizations and the accompanying caption:

1. The decompositions cover the period from 1990 to 2018.
2. The overall effect (represented by the solid line) is calculated using macro-level elasticities.
3. The within effect is computed using the micro-level elasticities.
4. The figure separates the impact into within substitution, between substitution, and markup.

Each graph displays how each factor (w/in Substitution, b/w Substitution, and Markup) contributed to changes in the labor share over time. 

In summary, the figure shows that both software and equipment contributions have impacted the labor share, with the overall trend indicating a decline over the given period. Additionally, the precise roles of within substitution, between substitution, and markup can be analyzed through these decompositions to explain the observed decline in labor share.
