The chart titled "Real Returns" presents a comparison between U.S. stock prices and real bond yields over the period of 2019 to 2023, represented using z-scores normalized for this time frame. The blue line denotes the 10-year TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) yield, while the red line represents the Wilshire 5000 price index.

**Summary:**
- **2019-2020:** Stock prices (red line) rose as real yields (blue line) fell, reflecting an inverse relationship between the two metrics.
- **2021:** There was a notable increase in stock prices as corporate earnings surged, all while real yields stayed low.
- **First Half of 2022:** A sharp rise in real yields coincided with a significant drawdown in stocks, indicating a negative impact on stock prices.
- **Post Half of 2022:** Despite continuous increases in real yields, stock prices showed no significant further impacts, suggesting a potential divergence in their relationship.

Overall, the chart captures the dynamic relationship between stock prices and real bond yields, highlighting periods where stock performance was closely tied to or independent of real yield fluctuations.
