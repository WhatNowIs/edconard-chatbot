The graphic outlines the expected dynamics in credit markets following a softening labor market, focusing on high yield (HY) yields (costs of capital) over time.

Here is a summary of the key points illustrated:

1. **Economy Slowing due to Federal Reserve Hikes:**
   - Both credit yields and base rates show a relatively stable behavior initially.
   - Credit spreads are maintained within a tight range.

2. **Nonfarm Payrolls Falling Below 100K:**
   - This marks the initial phase of market softening.
   - Credit spreads begin to widen, indicating increasing borrower risk.
   - However, inflation remains significantly above 2%, delaying a dovish shift by the Fed.

3. **Recession Begins:**
   - As recession sets in, inflation trends closer to the Fed's 2% target.
   - The Fed adopts a dovish stance and reduces base rates rapidly.
   - Despite the fall in base rates, credit spreads continue widening due to weakening earnings, increasing overall cost of capital.

In essence, as the labor market softens and recession begins, credit markets experience widening spreads and falling base rates driven by Federal Reserve policies aimed at managing inflation.
