### Summary of Figure 9: Non-AI-Related Vacancies by Level of AI Exposure

**Title:**
- Non-AI-Related Vacancies by Level of AI Exposure

**Data Source:**
- The data is presented by Daron Acemoglu in "Automation, AI and Wages," from a PowerPoint presentation for the Workforce Futures Initiative in October 2022.

**Scope:**
- The figure analyzes non-AI-related vacancies across different levels of AI exposure, grouped into quartiles, using three different measures: Felten et al Measure, SML Measure, and Webb Measure.
- Timeframe: Roughly from 2010 to 2020.

**Graphs:**
1. **Felten et al Measure:**
   - Displays total non-AI vacancies over time.
   - Vacancy trends are categorized by quartiles:
     - First Quartile (highest exposure): Black line.
     - Second Quartile: Orange line.
     - Third Quartile: Blue line.
     - Fourth Quartile (lowest exposure): Green line.
   - First Quartile shows the highest number of vacancies over time, followed by Second, Third, and Fourth Quartile.

2. **SML Measure:**
   - Similar structure as Felten et al Measure.
   - Trends in total non-AI vacancies are slightly different but follow a similar pattern.
   - First Quartile consistently shows higher vacancies than the other quartiles. 

3. **Webb Measure:**
   - Follows a similar distribution with First Quartile showing the highest number of vacancies.
   - The difference between the quartiles is visually significant, showing the reliance of non-AI-related jobs on AI exposure.

**Insights:**
- Across all three measures, the highest level of AI exposure (First Quartile) corresponds with the highest number of non-AI-related vacancies.
- There is a clear descending trend from the First Quartile to the Fourth Quartile in terms of the number of vacancies, indicating that non-AI job creation is correlated with AI exposure.

**Conclusion:**
- The analysis indicates that there is a correlation between AI exposure and non-AI-related job vacancies. More AI exposure correlates with higher vacancies in non-AI-related jobs, potentially suggesting complementarity or economic shifts benefiting both AI and non-AI sectors.
