This chart displays the trends of the U.S. current account compared to official inflows in the Balance of Payments (BoP) data from Q4 1995 to Q4 2022. The y-axis represents USD billion in trailing 4-quarter sums, while the x-axis shows the timeline by quarters.

Key aspects and trends observed:
1. **U.S. Current Account (Red Line)**:
   - The current account balance saw a gradual increase from around Q4 1995, peaking around Q4 2006 to Q4 2007.
   - There was a significant drop in the current account from Q4 2007 to Q4 2010, with fluctuations but no recovery to the previous peak thereafter.
   - Post-2015, the current account remains relatively stable but consistently negative, indicating a deficit, with a notable dip around Q4 2020, followed by a recent uptick heading into Q4 2022.

2. **Components of Official Inflows (Stacked Areas)**:
   - **Long-Term (LT) Treasuries (Green)**: 
     - Seen as the most stable inflow, with significant increases between Q4 2005 to Q4 2008 and after the financial crisis period until around Q4 2015.
   - **Long-Term (LT) Agencies (Light Blue)**:
     - Experienced some volatility but had prominent contributions in late 2008 to early 2009.
   - **Official Equities (Yellow)**:
     - Show minimal impact with some increase around Q4 2017 to Q4 2019 and a few scattered peaks.
   - **Short-Term (ST) Bills (Dark Blue)**:
     - Proficiency of these investments rose notably just after Q4 2008 financial crisis.
   - **Banks (Orange)**:
     - Have fluctuating contributions, with notable peaks and troughs, including significant roles around the financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic periods.

Summary:
The U.S. current account deficit tends to widen in times of economic stress, such as the financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Official inflows, particularly in LT Treasuries and Banks, appear to react strongly to these economic conditions. The stability in the current account deficit post-2015 suggests systemic underlying economic factors maintaining the deficit, despite fluctuations in various forms of official inflows.
