The graph examines the trend in CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation with annualized changes, segmented across several periods from 2017 to 2024 year-to-date (YTD). It presents different versions of the CPI:

- Total CPI
- "Ultracore" CPI (excluding food, energy, shelter, and used vehicles)
- "Sticky" prices excluding shelter
- 16% trimmed mean

Key points observed:
1. **High Inflation Peak (2021H2-2022H1):** The highest inflation rates among all categories were seen during the second half of 2021 and the first half of 2022, with Total CPI reaching around 8%.
2. **Recent Decline (2022H2-2023H2):** A noticeable decline in inflation rates occurs post-2022, with all categories significantly lowering their annualized changes by 2023H2.
3. **Stabilization in 2024YTD:** By the year 2024YTD, inflation rates appear to remain relatively stable, suggesting a limited change in price growth over the observed periods.
4. **Comparative Analysis:** Over the entire span, "Ultracore" CPI and "Sticky" prices show relatively flatter trends compared to Total CPI, indicating those measures of core inflation may be less volatile.

The data implies that while monthly inflation has decreased sharply since the beginning of 2023, a longer-term perspective over the past 18-24 months reflects little change in price growth.
