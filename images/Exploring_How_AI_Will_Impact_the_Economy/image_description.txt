The image depicts two line graphs titled "USA Productivity Growth (5yr, Ann)" which highlight how technological advancements have influenced productivity growth in the United States. Here's a summary of key points from the graphs:

### Electrification (Left Graph: 1880-1960)
- Notable technological milestones are marked:
  - **1st US Central Power Station** (timeline near 1880)
  - **Teslaâ€™s AC Induction Motor** (around the early 1900s)
- Following these developments, there is a substantial lag before a noticeable productivity boom.
- Significant growth in productivity is observed with peaks above 3% around the 1920s, then a decline follows.

### Computer Revolution (Right Graph: 1960-Present)
- Key technological milestones:
  - **1st Mass-Produced PCs** (timeline around the early 1970s)
  - **IBM PC** (early 1980s)
  - **World Wide Web** (early 1990s)
- Similar to the Electrification period, there is a lag before a productivity boom.
- A prominent rise in productivity growth is seen reaching above 2.5% during the late 1990s to early 2000s, circled in black.
- A subsequent decline is noted, with productivity falling close to 0% around the 2010s before a minor uptick post-2020.

### Conclusion
The graphs indicate that significant technological advancements contribute to productivity growth, but these effects manifest with a substantial lag. Both Electrification and the Computer Revolution show patterns where productivity growth peaks after initial technological introductions, followed by a decline. This lag highlights the time it takes for new technologies to be adopted and fully integrated into the economy to boost productivity.
