This bar graph titled "Figure 5. Effect of Years in Living Situation on Children Ever Born" illustrates the impact of various living situations on the number of children ever born, based on data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort. The graph measures the change in the number of children associated with 4 more years in each living situation, with the vertical axis representing the change in the number of children and the horizontal axis displaying different living scenarios.

The living situations evaluated are:
- Living with parents in rural, suburban, and city areas
- Renting or owning in rural, suburban, and city areas while living independently
- Residing in group quarters

Key observations:
1. **Living with Parents**: 
   - **Rural**: A significant negative effect, reducing the number of children ever born by around 0.25 to 0.30 children.
   - **Suburb**: A negative effect, reducing the number of children by around 0.20 children.
   - **City**: A substantial negative effect, reducing the number of children by approximately 0.30 children.

2. **Independent Living**:
   - **Rent in Rural Areas**: Approximately no effect.
   - **Own in Rural Areas**: Slight positive effect, increasing the number of children by around 0.05 children.
   - **Rent in Suburban Areas**: Slight positive effect, increasing the number of children by around 0.05 children.
   - **Own in Suburban Areas**: Neutral to slight positive effect.
   - **Rent in City**: Minor effect, slightly decreasing the number of children.
   - **Own in City**: Slight positive effect.

3. **Group Quarters**: 
   - Moderate negative effect, reducing the number of children by around 0.15 children.

The source of the data is derived from the author's calculations based on regression analyses of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort, presented by the Institute for Family Studies. The data indicate that living with parents, especially in urban areas, and residing in group quarters tends to significantly reduce the potential number of children ever born. Conversely, owning property in rural and suburban areas seems to have a slight positive impact on the number of children ever born.
