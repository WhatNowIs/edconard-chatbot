The image is a bar chart titled "Less than 20% of China’s soyabean supply comes from domestic farms," highlighting the percentage sources of soyabean supply in China from 2015 to 2022. The sources are categorized as the US, Brazil, Other countries, and Domestic production. Each bar is color-coded to indicate the contributing sources:

- **US (dark blue)**
- **Brazil (light blue)**
- **Other countries (gray)**
- **Domestic production (red)**

Key observations:

1. **Brazil** is consistently the largest source of China’s soyabean supply, occupying more than 40-60% of the total supply each year from 2015 to 2022. Its share slightly decreased around 2018-2019 but remains predominant.
2. **US** holds the second-largest share, contributing significantly in 2015-2017 and again increasing from 2020 to 2022 after a notable dip in 2018-2019.
3. **Other countries** provide a smaller portion of the supply, generally hovering around 10-20%, with some slight variations year by year.
4. **Domestic production** is consistently below 20%, illustrating that China heavily relies on imports to meet its soyabean needs. The domestic share remains relatively stable across the years.

In summary, the chart effectively conveys that China's soyabean supply largely depends on imports, primarily from Brazil and the US, with domestic production consistently accounting for less than 20% of the total supply from 2015 to 2022.
