The image is an illustration featuring a profile of a man against the backdrop of the American flag. The man's profile is projected in such a manner that his shadow takes on a distinctive, exaggerated form resembling another figure with a prominent noticeable feature (a large nose). The drawing employs shading and perspective to create this dual-image effect, symbolizing a connection or intersection between two personalities or ideas. The image conveys a narrative through visual symbolism, possibly alluding to political undertones, identity, or influence. The American flag behind sets a patriotic context, emphasizing the relevance of the imagery to American politics or society.

The signature “Ferguson” at the bottom right corner suggests this may be the artist who created the illustration.
