The image is a line graph titled "Figure 1: New business applications," illustrating the number of new business applications in thousands from 2004 to 2022. The data is sourced from the Census Bureau Business Formation Statistics and indicates seasonally adjusted figures. The graph categorizes applications into three types: All applications (black solid line), Likely employers (green dashed line), and Likely nonemployers (red dotted line).

Key observations include:

1. **Overall Trend**:
   - From 2004 to 2022, there is a general upward trend in the total number of business applications.
   - A significant jump in the total applications is observed starting around 2020.

2. **Breakdown of Applications**:
   - The likely employers' series remains relatively stable over the years, hovering around 100 thousand with minor fluctuations.
   - Likely nonemployers also show consistent trends but start rising noticeably from 2020 onwards, surpassing 300 thousand at certain points.

3. **Recession Impact**:
   - Two shaded areas mark the recession periods identified by the NBER (National Bureau of Economic Research). The first is during the late 2000s (2007-2009), and the second is from 2020.
   - There is a visible dip during the 2007-2009 recession across all metrics, followed by a recovery.
   - The 2020 recession shows a substantial initial spike in nonemployers and total applications, indicating potentially higher entrepreneurial activities possibly as a response to the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

4. **Post-Recession Behavior**:
   - After the initial spike during the 2020 recession, applications tend to stabilize but remain higher than pre-2020 levels.

In summary, new business applications exhibited a steady increase over the years, with a notable surge during the 2020 recession period. Likely nonemployers showed a substantial rise post-2020, reflecting increased entrepreneurial activities, possibly driven by the economic disruptions caused by COVID-19.
