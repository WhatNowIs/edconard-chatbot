### Summary:
From 2022 to 2023, the venture capital funding environment saw notable increases in the percentage of down rounds across all series, with Series C and beyond experiencing the most significant upticks. Correspondingly, there were steeper median declines in post-money valuations, particularly in the Series B and C stages. Series E rounds were hit hardest in both years, with around half of their valuations decreasing. This indicates a generally tougher funding landscape in 2023 compared to 2022.
