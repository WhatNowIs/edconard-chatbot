The table titled "Initial Worker Composition and AI Investments" outlines the relationship between the share of AI workers from 2010 to 2018 and various worker characteristics measured in 2010. Specifically, it looks at the changes in the share of AI workers and how these changes correlate with different initial worker composition metrics from 2010 across four columns of regression analysis.

**Key summarized points:**

1. **Columns Analyzed**: The analysis is divided into four columns, and each column represents different regression models.

2. **Worker Characteristics** (2010):
   - **Share of Workers with Low Seniority**: Negative correlation across all models, significant in (3) and (4).
   - **Share of Workers with Medium Seniority**: Negative correlation, but not significant in all columns.
   - **Share of Workers with College Degree**: Consistently negative correlation across all models.
   - **Share of Workers with Master Degree**: Positive correlation, significant in (2), (3), and (4).
   - **Share of Workers with Doctor Degree**: Strong positive correlation, highly significant across all models.
   - **Share of Workers with STEM Major**: Positive correlation, highly significant.
   - **Share of Workers with Social Science Major**: Mixed correlation, not significant in all columns.
   - **Share of Workers with Fine Arts Major**: Predominantly positive correlation, significant in model (3).
   - **Share of Workers with Humanities Major**: Positive correlation, not significant.

3. **Industry Sector Fixed Effects**: All models control for industry sector fixed effects.

4. **Adjusted R-Squared**: Varies between 0.096 and 0.158 indicating varying explanatory power across models.

5. **Observations**: Consistent 1,216 observations, ensuring robustness in the datasets.

**Summary**:

The analysis reveals that the initial educational composition significantly influences the share of AI workers over the eight years from 2010 to 2018. Notably, higher initial shares of workers with advanced degrees (Master or Doctorate) and STEM majors have a strong and positive association with the increase in AI workers. In contrast, a higher share of workers with low or medium seniority and college degrees in 2010 generally predicts a decline in the share of AI workers, suggesting that firms with more specialized and highly educated workforces are better positioned to grow their AI workforce.
