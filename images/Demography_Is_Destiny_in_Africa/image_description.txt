The image is a line graph titled "Global Population Growth Projections" showing population trends from 1950 to 2100 for various regions. The data was compiled by the U.N. Population Division, with projections estimating future population sizes based on factors such as fertility, mortality, and international migration levels across 237 countries or areas.

### Key Points:

1. **Regions Tracked:**
   - Sub-Saharan Africa (green)
   - Central and Southern Asia (yellow)
   - Eastern and Southeastern Asia (light grey)
   - Europe and Northern America (dark blue)
   - Northern Africa and Western Asia (brown)
   - Latin America and the Caribbean (blue)
   - Australia and New Zealand (Cyan)
   - Oceania (yellow-green)

2. **Projections:**
   - **Sub-Saharan Africa**: Projected to be home to 33% of the worldâ€™s population by the end of the 21st century, showing a steep and continuous increase.
   - **Central and Southern Asia**: Expected to reach a population peak and then slowly decline.
   - **Eastern and Southeastern Asia**: Projected to peak around mid-century and then decline steadily.
   - **Europe and Northern America**: Relatively stable with slight oscillations.
   - **Other Regions**: Show modest increases or stability, with no dramatic growth projected.

3. **Population Milestones:**
   - Most regions show growth peaks mid-century, with some then experiencing declines.
   - Sub-Saharan Africa exhibits the most significant ongoing growth trend throughout the century.

### Additional Note:
- Oceania's figures exclude Australia and New Zealand.

This projection assists in planning for resource distribution, policy-making, and understanding future demographic challenges.
