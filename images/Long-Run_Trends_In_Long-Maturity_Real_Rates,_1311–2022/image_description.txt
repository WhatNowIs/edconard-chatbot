The table titled "Macro Variables: Averages by Period (in percent per annum)" presents data across different historical periods for three key macroeconomic variables: real aggregate output growth rate, aggregate population growth rate, and real interest rate. The time periods covered are 1318–2021, 1318–1500, 1500–1800, 1800–1914, and 1914–2021. Here is a summary of the average values for these periods:

1. **Real Aggregate Output Growth Rate:**
   - 1318–2021: 1.04%
   - 1318–1500: 0.14%
   - 1500–1800: 0.48%
   - 1800–1914: 2.08%
   - 1914–2021: 2.99%

2. **Aggregate Population Growth Rate:**
   - 1318–2021: 0.37%
   - 1318–1500: -0.17%
   - 1500–1800: 0.29%
   - 1800–1914: 1.03%
   - 1914–2021: 0.81%

3. **Real Interest Rate:**
   - 1318–2021: 6.16%
   - 1318–1500: 11.17%
   - 1500–1800: 5.87%
   - 1800–1914: 3.67%
   - 1914–2021: 1.14%

**Key Trends:**
- There is an increasing trend in the real aggregate output growth rate, especially notable after 1800.
- Population growth was negative between 1318 and 1500 but has generally increased since then, peaking between 1800 and 1914.
- Real interest rates have shown a significant decline over the centuries, with the highest rates observed between 1318 and 1500 and the lowest between 1914 and 2021.

**Notes:**
The data are based on a GW-weighted sample of eight advanced economies, and more detailed sources and notes can be found in Figures 2 and 3 of the original document.
