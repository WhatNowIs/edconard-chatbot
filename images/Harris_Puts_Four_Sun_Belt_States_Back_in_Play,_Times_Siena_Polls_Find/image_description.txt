The New York Times/Siena College Poll, conducted from August 8 to 15, surveyed preferences among likely voters in four states—Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada, and Georgia—on a hypothetical 2024 presidential election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.

The poll results are as follows:
- **Arizona**: Kamala Harris leads with 50% while Donald Trump has 45%.
- **North Carolina**: Donald Trump holds a slight lead with 47% compared to Kamala Harris's 49%.
- **Nevada**: Kamala Harris has a narrow lead with 48% compared to Donald Trump's 47%.
- **Georgia**: Kamala Harris has an advantage with 50% against Donald Trump's 46%.

The results indicate close races in all four states. Margins of error vary, with Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia having a margin of plus or minus 4.4 points, and North Carolina having a margin of plus or minus 4.2 points.

The analysis was performed by Lily Boyce and Andrew Park.
