The image is a chart showing the performance of the Bloomberg Office Property REIT Index from 1993 to 2020. The chart highlights that office Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) have seen significant fluctuations over the past 27 years but have ultimately returned to the same level as in 1996. The index had reached its peak above 400, but over the past year, it has dramatically halved, reaching a current level equivalent to values observed back in 1996. The visual underscores the long-term stagnation and recent significant drop in the performance of office REITs.
