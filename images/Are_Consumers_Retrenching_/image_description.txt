The image titled "The Big Slowdown" conveys the recent trends in consumer spending on goods and services, highlighting a significant deceleration. According to the chart, spending has grown at a yearly rate of just 4% in the current year. This growth rate is noted to be the slowest since the economy reopened post-COVID-19 pandemic and is slightly below the pre-pandemic average.

The graphical representation of "Consumer spending (5-month changes annualized)" reveals data on:
1. Total consumer spending (indicated by a blue line).
2. Consumer spending excluding groceries, energy, and imputations (indicated by a red line).

The graph clearly shows a decline in both measures after a notable peak in 2021. From around 2017 to 2019, the growth rates fluctuated but remained relatively stable below 10%. There was a sharp increase in spending levels in mid-2020, peaking dramatically before falling back. This spike is attributable to the economic reopening, followed by erratic patterns in 2021-2022. However, a consistent slowdown has been observed, with rates declining steadily into 2023.

The data source is the Bureau of Economic Analysis, with calculations by Matthew Klein. The sharp fluctuations observed around 2020-2021 coincide with the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic changes, emphasizing the pandemic's impact on consumer behavior.

In summary, consumer spending growth has significantly slowed to the lowest levels since the economic reopening, signaling potential concerns for economic momentum moving forward.
