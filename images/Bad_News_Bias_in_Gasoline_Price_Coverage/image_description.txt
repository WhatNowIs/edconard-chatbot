The image is a scatter plot with a trend line illustrating the relationship between TV mentions (as a percent of transcripts) and nominal gas prices (in dollars per gallon). The plot title indicates that TV coverage increases when the nominal gas price hits $3.50 per gallon.

Key Points:
- The x-axis represents the nominal gas price in dollars per gallon, ranging from approximately $1.50 to $5.00.
- The y-axis represents the percentage of TV mentions in transcripts, ranging from 0% to 40%.
- The scatter plot shows the individual data points, with a noticeable increase in TV mentions once gas prices exceed roughly $3.50 per gallon.
- The trend line suggests a positive correlation between nominal gas prices and the percentage of TV mentions.
- There is a vertical dashed line at $3.50/gal, highlighting the point where TV coverage starts to ramp up significantly.

Summary:
The graph demonstrates that TV coverage of gas prices remains relatively low and stable when prices are below $3.50 per gallon. However, once gas prices exceed $3.50 per gallon, there is a noticeable increase in TV mentions, indicating that media attention around gas prices intensifies as they get higher.
