The image illustrates the effect of exposure to affirmative action bans on college degree attainment for Black and Hispanic men and women relative to non-Hispanic Whites. The data is presented across four states: California, Texas, Washington, and Florida. Each state is split into separate graphs for men and women. The data points show the differences in college degree attainment by year, with confidence intervals indicated to show the robustness of the estimates.

### Key Information:
- **Y-axis:** College Degree Differentials
- **X-axis:** Year at Age 17 relative to Year of Ban in Birth State
- **Sample:** Census 2000 and ACS 2001-2021. Ages 25-51 in survey year and aged 17 within 20 years of State affirmative action ban.
- **Notes:** Heteroskedasticity-robust 95% confidence intervals shown around the point estimates. Regressions are estimated separately by state and for non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Hispanics. Sampling weights were used in calculations.
- **Legend:**
  - Red line: Non-Hispanic Black
  - Blue line: Hispanic

### Observations:
- **California:** For both men and women, there appears to be some fluctuation in college degree differentials around the year of the ban, with overlapping confidence intervals indicating no significant effects for most years.
- **Texas:** Similar patterns are observed, with minor differences fluctuating around zero and overlapping confidence intervals.
- **Washington:** Both men and women show more pronounced fluctuations, but these also generally hover around zero with overlapping confidence intervals.
- **Florida:** The patterns for both men and women again show some fluctuation around zero, but with overlapping confidence intervals.

### Summary:
The effect of exposure to affirmative action bans on college degree attainment for Black and Hispanic individuals relative to non-Hispanic Whites appears to be minimal across California, Texas, Washington, and Florida. The confidence intervals generally overlap zero, suggesting no significant differences in college degree attainment following the imposition of these bans. This suggests that, although there are some minor variations, the overall impact of these affirmative action bans might not be substantial.
