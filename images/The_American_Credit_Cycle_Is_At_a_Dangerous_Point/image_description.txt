The image is a graph taken from The Economist that illustrates the trend of nominal GDP percentage change on a quarterly basis and the Federal Funds target rate in the United States over a period from 2018 to 2024.

Key points:
- **Nominal GDP, % change on previous quarter**:
  - Starting in 2018, the GDP growth rate fluctuated around 0%.
  - There is a significant dip to nearly -40% in 2020, indicative of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
  - This is followed by a sharp rebound to almost 40%.
  - Post-rebound, GDP growth shows a volatile pattern but stabilizes around 0-10% in the subsequent years up to 2023.
  - Future projections (2023 and 2024 estimates) indicate a stabilization close to 0%.

- **Federal Funds target rate, %**:
  - The Federal Funds rate remains relatively stable around 2.5% from 2018 until the beginning of 2020.
  - There is a sharp decline as the rate is reduced to almost 0% in response to the COVID-19 economic shock.
  - Following this decline, the target rate starts to gradually increase during 2022.
  - Projections for 2023 and 2024 indicate the rate will stabilize around 5%.

Both data sources are cited as BEA (Bureau of Economic Analysis) and Bloomberg.

The graph effectively captures the dramatic economic fluctuations due to the pandemic and the subsequent recovery and stabilization efforts, particularly highlighting the Federal Reserve's response in adjusting the Federal Funds target rate to manage economic stability.
