The provided visual consists of two scatter plots, which illustrate the relationship between the U.S. Treasury (UST) Liquidity Index and Implied Volatility for the 2-Year and 10-Year tenors over the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

Key takeaways:

1. **Increased Volatility and Decreased Liquidity**: Both scatter plots highlight that the U.S. Treasury market has experienced increased volatility and decreased liquidity over recent years.
   
2. **2-Year Tenor**:
   - The left scatter plot displays U.S. Treasury Liquidity Index versus Implied Volatility for the 2-Year tenor.
   - Data points from 2019, and 2020 (grey and orange) are clustered toward lower volatility and liquidity.
   - Data points from 2022 and 2023 (purple) are more spread out, indicating higher volatility and decreased liquidity in the 2-Year tenor.

3. **10-Year Tenor**:
   - The right scatter plot illustrates U.S. Treasury Liquidity Index versus Implied Volatility for the 10-Year tenor.
   - Similar to the 2-Year tenor, earlier years (2019 and 2020) show data points with lower volatility and relatively higher liquidity.
   - Later years (2022 and 2023) indicate a higher dispersion of data points, signifying increased volatility and diminished liquidity.

Both scatter plots collectively underscore the trend that the U.S. Treasury market has become more volatile and less liquid in recent years, impacting both the 2-Year and 10-Year tenors.
