1. **Initial Drop and Gradual Recovery**: 
   - In March 2020, all cities show a significant drop in occupancy.
   - Occupancy levels stay low but show gradual recovery throughout 2020 into 2021.

2. **Acceleration in Recovery**: 
   - Noticeable increase in occupancy during the latter part of 2021.
