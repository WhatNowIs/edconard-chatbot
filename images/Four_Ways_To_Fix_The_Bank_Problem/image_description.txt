The chart titled "This is already a large banking crisis" illustrates the magnitude of US bank failures from 1981 to 2023. It presents data on bank assets, Bear Stearns & Lehman assets, and FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) losses across this period.

Key points from the chart include:

1. **Bank Assets (1981-2023)**:
   - A significant spike in bank failures is observed around 2008-2010, peaking at approximately $1200 billion in bank assets.
   - Lesser peaks are present in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but these are considerably smaller than the 2008-2010 peak.
   - Another noticeable increase is seen in 2023, reaching an estimated $1000 billion in bank assets, indicating a recent banking crisis.

2. **Bear Stearns & Lehman Assets**:
   - The assets of Bear Stearns & Lehman Brothers, indicated in the blue color, are marked prominently around the 2008 financial crisis but do not appear as substantial after this period.

3. **FDIC Losses (1981-2023)**:
   - FDIC losses are notably high around 2008, peaking at around $25 billion.
   - There are smaller peaks in losses during the late 1980s and early 1990s, similar to the trend in bank asset failures.
   - Post-2010, the FDIC losses remain relatively low till 2023, where a slight increase is observed.

Overall, the chart emphasizes the severity of the 2008 financial crisis and indicates that 2023 is experiencing another significant banking crisis with elevated bank asset failures, though the FDIC losses are not as high as in 2008.
