The chart from "The Conversation" sourced from "Monitoring the Future" illustrates the declining trend in the percentage of teens who meet up with their friends 'almost every day'. The chart spans from around 1975 to 2015 and tracks 8th-graders, 10th-graders, and 12th-graders.

Key points are:

1. **Overall Decline**: There is a clear decline in the percentage of teens meeting their friends daily over the years.
2. **Accelerated Decline post-2010**: The decline becomes notably steeper after 2010, suggesting a significant change in social behavior among teens during this period.
3. **Similar Trends Across Grades**: The patterns of decline are consistent across all three grades (8th, 10th, and 12th), though they do not precisely overlap.

This data highlights a significant shift in how often teens engage in physical social interactions with friends over the decades, with a notable acceleration in recent years.
