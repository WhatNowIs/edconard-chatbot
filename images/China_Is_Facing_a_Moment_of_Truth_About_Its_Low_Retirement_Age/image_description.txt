The image presents a bar graph titled "Senior Movement" which illustrates the aging population trend in China, France, and the U.S. over the years 1950, 2023, and projected data for 2100. The bars represent the percentage of the population that is 60 years old or older.

Key Points:
1. In 1950:
   - China had a lower percentage of its population aged 60 or older compared to France and the U.S.
   - The percentage was below 10% for China, while closer to 15% for France and slightly over 10% for the U.S.
   
2. By 2023:
   - The aging population increased significantly in all three countries.
   - Chinaâ€™s percentage jumped to about 25%, surpassing both France and the U.S., which were both around 20%.

3. Projections for 2100:
   - China is expected to have the highest percentage of its population aged 60 or older, over 40%.
   - France and the U.S. are also expected to see significant increases, both surpassing 30%, with France slightly higher than the U.S.

Overall Summary:
The graph indicates that China is experiencing a faster rate of population aging compared to both France and the U.S. Starting from a lower percentage in 1950, China is projected to have a higher percentage of its population aged 60 or older by 2100, reflecting significant demographic changes and challenges ahead for its society and economy.
