The image is a scatter plot graph illustrating the relationship between cumulative Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation, in percentage, and household income percentile from May 2020 to May 2022.

Key Points:
1. **X-axis (Household income percentile)**: Spans from 0 to 100, increasing from left to right, indicating lower to higher income households.
2. **Y-axis (Cumulative CPI inflation, %)**: Ranges approximately from 13% to 17%.
3. **Data points**: Each dot represents a household's cumulative CPI inflation percentage over the specified period.
4. **Trend Line**: An inverted U-shaped curve shows the general trend. It indicates:
   - Inflation impacts are higher for middle-income percentiles (peaking around the 50th percentile).
   - Both the lowest and highest income percentiles experienced relatively lower cumulative CPI inflation.

Summary: 
From May 2020 to May 2022, middle-income households faced the highest cumulative CPI inflation, while both lower-income and upper-income households experienced comparatively lesser inflation rates. The trend suggests a non-linear relationship between income percentiles and experienced inflation rates during this period.
