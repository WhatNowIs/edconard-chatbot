The presented figure investigates the evolution of wealth shares for the top 10% and top 1% of the population, considering the incorporation of Social Security wealth.

### Summary:

**Objective:**
The charts illustrate the impact of including Social Security wealth on the wealth shares of the top 10% (Panel A) and top 1% (Panel B) from 1989 to 2019.

**Valuation Methods:**
1. **No Social Security (Blue Dotted Line):** Wealth shares calculated without factoring in Social Security wealth.
2. **Risk-Free Valuation (Black Solid Line):** Wealth shares with cash flows discounted using yield curves from government bonds.
3. **Risk-Adjusted Valuation (Red Dashed Line):** Wealth shares with adjusted discount rates to account for long-run cointegration between labor and stock markets.

**Findings:**
- For both the top 10% and top 1%, incorporating Social Security wealth reduces the reported wealth shares compared to the "No Social Security" scenario.
- The gap between the "No Social Security" wealth shares and the adjusted valuations increases over time, indicating a growing disparity when Social Security is accounted for.

### Detail Analysis:

**Top 10% Wealth Shares (Panel A):**
- The wealth share remains around 6-7% in the "No Social Security" scenario throughout the period.
- Risk-free and Risk-adjusted valuations show lower wealth shares, around 5-6%, with similar trends.

**Top 1% Wealth Shares (Panel B):**
- The top 1% wealth share shows a value around 3-4% without Social Security.
- Risk-free and Risk-adjusted valuations show significantly lower wealth shares, at approximately 2-3%.

The chart effectively demonstrates the substantial impact Social Security wealth has on reducing the wealth concentration among the top earners, especially when considering long-term financial market integration.
