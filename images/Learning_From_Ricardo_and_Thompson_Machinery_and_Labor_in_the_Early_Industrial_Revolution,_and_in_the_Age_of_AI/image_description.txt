The chart in Figure 3 displays the real weekly wages of textile workers from 1806 to 1862, indexed to the cost of living values of 1806 (1806 = 100). The data is sourced from Allen (2007) and Clark (2010), with different wage assessments for handloom weavers and factory workers.

Key insights from the chart are:

1. **Handloom Weavers (Allen's Data, Orange Line)**:
   - Real wages were relatively high in the early 1800s but sharply declined around the 1820s.
   - Post-1820, wages remained low, experiencing minor fluctuations, but never regained the earlier levels.

2. **Factory Workers (Allen's Data, Yellow Line)**:
   - Show a different trend with more stability, and modest increments over the entire period, surpassing handloom weaver wages after the sharp decline the latter faced.

3. **Handloom Weavers (Clark's Data, Blue Line)**:
   - Initially high, decreasing slightly towards the early 1820s, then a relative increase in wage levels is seen with moderate fluctuations post-1820.
   - Despite fluctuations, there is a notable increase towards the late 1850s and early 1860s.

4. **Factory Workers (Clark's Data, Green Line)**:
   - Exhibits a generally increasing trend throughout the period, indicating relative economic stability or growth for factory workers.
   - The wage line shows a steady rise, notable in the latter half of the 19th century, indicating improved economic conditions or labor demand for factory workers.

5. **Weighted Average Weaving Wage (Clark's Data, Grey Line)**:
   - Similar trends to individual series, displaying overall economic conditions for weaving workers, with wages initially lower but eventually showing improvement, mimicking factory workers' trends, particularly towards the closure of the depicted period.

Overall, the chart highlights the broader economic trends affecting textile workers across the different periods, showing a substantial decline for handloom weavers, juxtaposed with relative improvement and stability for factory workers. The contrast suggests structural changes within the textile industry, possibly favoring mechanization and factory-based production over traditional handloom weaving.
