Exhibit 5 from the Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research illustrates projections for the increase in interest expense due to refinancing maturing debt. Key highlights from the data are as follows:

1. **Incremental Increase in Interest Expense from Bonds Maturing by Year (Left Chart):**
   - The interest expense is anticipated to rise significantly in the upcoming years.
   - The most substantial increase is expected in 2025, close to 6.5%.
   - The projected incremental increase remains relatively high from 2025 through 2029, peaking in 2026-2027.
   - It then shows a gradual decline from 2030 to 2034.

2. **Cumulative Increase in Interest Expense (Right Chart):**
   - The cumulative increase in interest expense is forecasted to steadily grow each year till 2034.
   - The cumulative impact reaches around 0.35% of private gross output by 2026.
   - By 2034, this number is expected to surpass 1.2%, indicating a long-term rise in interest expenses.

3. **Key Assumptions:**
   - These projections are based on the assumption that yields on individual corporate bonds will evolve according to the strategists' views on market interest rates.
   - Beyond the strategists' forecast horizons, the projections assume unchanged yields and spreads.

Overall, the data suggests that the refinancing of maturing debt will lead to an increase in interest expenses over the next decade, with a noticeable spike expected in 2025. This projected increase in interest expense could have significant implications for private gross output by the year 2034.
