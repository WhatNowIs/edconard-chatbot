The image is a bar chart showing the global market share for CPUs in servers by Intel and AMD from 2019 to 2024. The chart indicates that:

- Intel's market share (represented in blue) has been gradually decreasing, starting at approximately 95% in 2019 and declining to around 80% projected in 2024.
- AMD's market share (represented in gray) has been steadily increasing, starting from a minimal value of approximately 5% in 2019 and is projected to reach around 20% by 2024.

These trends reflect a gradual shift in the server CPU market share from Intel to AMD over the observed period. The figures for 2024 are estimates.
