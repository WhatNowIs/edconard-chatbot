The graph, titled "The Upward Trend in Reservation Wages Is Primarily Driven by Employed Respondents," shows the average reservation wage, which is the minimum wage that survey respondents are willing to accept for a new job, tracked from March 2014 to March 2022. The data is divided between employed respondents (red line) and non-employed respondents (blue line).

Key Findings:
1. **General Trend**:
   - There is an upward trend in reservation wages for both employed and non-employed respondents over the years.
   
2. **Employed Respondents**:
   - The average reservation wage for employed respondents started around $62,000 in March 2014.
   - It increased to approximately $80,000 by March 2022.
   - A noticeable acceleration in the increase of reservation wages for employed respondents is observed after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (indicated by the vertical line).

3. **Non-employed Respondents**:
   - The average reservation wage for non-employed respondents was roughly $46,000 in March 2014.
   - This figure gradually increased to around $55,000 by March 2022.
   - The increase is less pronounced compared to the employed respondents.

4. **Impact of the Pandemic**:
   - Both groups show an increase in reservation wages post-March 2020, with a more significant rise observed among employed respondents.

Source Information:
- Data is sourced from the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCE) Labor Market Survey.
- The vertical line in the graph indicates the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In summary, the upward trend in reservation wages is more significantly influenced by employed respondents, particularly noticeable after the start of the pandemic.
