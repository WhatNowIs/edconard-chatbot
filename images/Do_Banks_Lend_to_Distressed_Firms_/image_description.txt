The image is a graph titled "Figure 1: Decision analysis for evergreening loans," illustrating the relationship between borrowing rates and the outstanding debt of a firm across different regions: normal funding, evergreening, and liquidation.

1. **Axes and Labels**:
   - **Vertical Axis (Y-Axis)**: Borrowing rate.
   - **Horizontal Axis (X-Axis)**: Outstanding debt of the firm.

2. **Regions**:
   - **Normal Funding Region**: On the left side of the graph. This is where the firm's borrowing rate environment is within the range that prevents default and allows for normal operation.
   - **Evergreening Region**: The middle region of the graph. In this area, the firm borrows at rates to maintain operations but not enough to reduce their debt significantly, possibly indicating a riskier financial position.
   - **Liquidation Region**: The right side of the graph. Debt levels reach a point where the borrowing rate becomes unsustainable, leading to potential liquidation.

3. **Key Rates**:
   - **Maximum Rate to Avoid Firm Default** (Blue line): Represents the highest rate at which the firm can borrow without defaulting, starts high and decreases as debt increases.
   - **Minimum Rate for Lending** (Green line): Shows the minimum rate at which a bank is willing to lend to the firm, slightly increasing with greater debt.
   - **Bank Lending Rate** (Yellow line): The rate at which the bank is currently lending to the firm, intersects between the maximum rate to avoid default and the minimum lending rate, decreasing as debt increases.
   - **External Bank Lending Rate** (Dashed Red line): Constant rate throughout the chart, representing an external factor or market rate.

This graph visually explains how firms navigate different borrowing conditions and risks, especially concerning their debt levels and associated borrowing rates. As debt increases, the decision for banks to lend and the firm's ability to avoid default come under scrutiny, potentially leading to evergreening practices and, ultimately, liquidation if debt becomes too substantial.
