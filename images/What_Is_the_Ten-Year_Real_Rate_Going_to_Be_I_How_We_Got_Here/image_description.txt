This graph from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) provides a historical overview of three financial indicators from around 1965 to 2023. The three indicators are:

1. **Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant Maturity:**
   - Represented by the red line.
   - Indicates the investment return on 10-year U.S. Treasury securities.
   - There was a significant rise in yields through the late 1970s, peaking around 1980. Subsequently, yields declined steeply through the 1980s and continued a gradual decline until around 2020.
   - Post-2020, there has been an upward trend in yields.

2. **Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant Maturity, Inflation-Indexed:**
   - Represented by the blue line.
   - Shows the real return on 10-year U.S. Treasury securities, adjusted for inflation.
   - This metric appears to fluctuate more, especially visible from the 2000s onwards with notable dips and rises, reflecting the inflation-adjusted yield's sensitivity to economic conditions.

3. **10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate:**
   - Represented by the green line.
   - The breakeven inflation rate illustrates the market's expectations for inflation over the next ten years.
   - The green line shows a relatively stable trend with slight fluctuations until around 2020 when it begins to rise again.

A closer analysis of the graph reveals some important periods:
- **Late 1970s to Early 1980s:** High inflation and corresponding high market yields on nominal Treasury securities.
- **1980s to Early 2000s:** A general decline in yields, reflecting decreasing inflation and interest rates.
- **Post-2008 Financial Crisis:** Continued low yields with more fluctuation, especially for inflation-indexed yields.
- **Post-2020:** Rising trends in all three indicators likely reflecting increasing inflation concerns and economic adjustments following the COVID-19 pandemic.

The grey shaded areas indicate periods of recession, highlighting how each indicator responds during economic downturns. Yields generally decrease during these periods as monetary policy becomes more accommodative.
