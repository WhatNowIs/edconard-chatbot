The chart illustrates the annual wage growth differential between individuals with a Bachelor's degree or higher and those with a high school diploma or less from 1998 to 2023. The data, sourced from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, is plotted against various economic recessions indicated by shaded areas.

Key points:
- In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the wage growth differential was positive, peaking around 1.5 percentage points.
- From the mid-2000s to late 2010s, this differential fluctuated but generally remained above zero, suggesting that the wage growth for individuals with higher education was consistently outpacing those with lower education.
- However, after 2018, the differential started to decline sharply, eventually turning negative in the early 2020s.
- By 2021, the gap had widened to approximately -1.5 percentage points, indicating that in recent years, the wage growth for individuals with a high school diploma or less has surpassed that of those with a Bachelor's degree or higher.
