The image is a chart from Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research titled "Exhibit 13: Even Before AI Starts to Impact Long-Term Growth, It Could Drive a Large Capital Investment Cycle, Particularly in the US." The chart illustrates projected AI-related investments in the US as a percentage of GDP from 2024 to 2040.

Key Points:
1. The chart depicts three categories of AI investments: 
   - Hardware for user queries (gray)
   - Hardware for model training (light blue)
   - Software (dark blue)

2. Projections indicate a significant rise in AI-related investments over the period.
   - Starting at below 0.5% of GDP in 2024.
   - Peaking around 2.5% of GDP between 2032-2034.
   - Slight decline but stabilizing around 2% of GDP by 2040.

3. Hardware investments (both user queries and model training) show substantial increases, particularly for user queries hardware peaking significantly by 2034.
4. Software investments also show a steady increase over the years but at a more constant rate compared to hardware.

Overall, the chart suggests that even before AI starts to impact long-term growth substantially, it is projected to drive a considerable cycle of capital investment, predominantly in hardware for user queries and model training, with software investment growing steadily.
