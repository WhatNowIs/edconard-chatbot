The provided chart analyzes real spot and forward 5-year yields on U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) from 2003 to 2023. The data demonstrates the variations in yields and the implied spread between spot and forward rates over this period.

### Key Points:

- **Spot 5-year Yield:** Represented by the light blue line, has experienced a variety of fluctuations over the 20-year span with peaks around 2007-2008 and significant drops around 2009 and again around 2013.
- **5-year Yield Five Years Forward:** Represented by the darker blue line, also shows fluctuations closely mirroring those of the spot 5-year yield but with notable differences in magnitude and occasionally in direction.
- **Implied Spread:** The red line illustrates the forward spread above the spot yield, indicating a trend where forward rates were higher than spot rates most of the time until around 2014, and thereafter showing generally closer proximity or even inversion in some periods.
- **Pre-Pandemic Average Spread:** The dotted red line shows the average spread before the pandemic (2003-2019), which remained fairly constant at approximately 1%. The current spread is noted to be 1.5 percentage points below this pre-pandemic average.

### Observations:

1. **Pre-2008 Financial Crisis:** Both spot and forward yields were relatively stable, and the implied spread was consistent with the pre-pandemic average spread.
2. **2008 Financial Crisis:** Sharp drops in real yields, both spot and forward, with the implied spread briefly turning negative.
3. **Post-2008 to 2014:** Recovery period showing growing yields and wider implied spreads.
4. **2014 to 2020:** Decline and stabilization period, with both spot and forward yields decreasing significantly and the implied spread narrowing.
5. **Post-2020 Pandemic Era:** Increased volatility with significant jumps especially in forward yields in the most recent data points.

In summary, the chart highlights the historical trends and variations of real yields and the implied spread on TIPS, with attention to the discrepancy between forward and spot rates, which has varied significantly over time, particularly influenced by major economic events such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.
