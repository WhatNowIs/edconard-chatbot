The image, Exhibit 15 from a McKinsey & Company report, illustrates the potential impact of generative AI on productivity growth across various economies from 2022 to 2040. The productivity impact is measured as a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in percentages. The data is broken down into early and late adoption scenarios, with additional productivity growth attributed to generative AI highlighted.

Key points from the image are summarized below:

### Global Impact:
- Early Adoption: Generative AI can contribute an additional 0.6% to the already projected 2.6%, making it a total of 3.3%.
- Late Adoption: Generative AI contributes an additional 0.2%, bringing the total productivity gain to 0.3%.

### Developed Economies:
1. **Japan:**
   - Early: 3.7% without AI + 0.6% with AI = 4.2%
   - Late: 1.4% without AI + 0.1% with AI = 1.6%

2. **Germany:**
   - Early: 3.4% without AI + 0.6% with AI = 3.9%
   - Late: 1.1% without AI + 0.2% with AI = 1.3%

3. **France:**
   - Early: 3.0% without AI + 0.7% with AI = 3.7%
   - Late: 0.6% without AI + 0.2% with AI = 0.8%

4. **United States:**
   - Early: 2.9% without AI + 0.7% with AI = 3.6%
   - Late: 0.2% without AI + 0.3% with AI = 0.6%

### Emerging Economies:
1. **China:**
   - Early: 3.2% without AI + 0.6% with AI = 3.8%
   - Late: 0.8% without AI + 0.7% with AI = 1.5%

2. **Mexico:**
   - Early: 2.3% without AI + 0.6% with AI = 2.9%
   - Late: 0.0% without AI

3. **India:**
   - Early: 1.8% without AI + 0.5% with AI = 2.3%
   - Late: 0.0% without AI

4. **South Africa:**
   - Early: 1.7% without AI + 0.5% with AI = 2.3%
   - Late: 0.0% without AI

### Notes:
- Figures may not sum due to rounding.
- The projections assume that automated work hours are reintegrated into the workforce at today's productivity levels.
- Previous assessments did not consider the rise of generative AI.
- Data is based on 47 countries, representing 80% of global employment.

The insights highlight that economies, both developed and emerging, stand to gain substantial productivity growth from early adoption of generative AI, potentially reshaping productivity landscapes significantly by 2040.
