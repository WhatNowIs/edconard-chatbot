The image is a line graph titled "Export volumes, change since January 2022," sourced from the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis. It compares the change in export volumes of China with the rest of the world from January 2022 to early 2024.

Key observations include:

1. **China's Export Volumes**:
   - The export volumes for China, represented by the red line, displayed significant volatility throughout 2022 and 2023.
   - There were steep declines, particularly noticeable in mid-2022, followed by sharp increases and subsequent fluctuations.
   - By early 2024, China's export volumes have considerably increased, reaching around a 10% change since January 2022.

2. **Rest of the World's Export Volumes**:
   - The rest of the world, represented by the tan line, showed much less fluctuation.
   - The change in export volumes hovered close to 0% throughout the observed period, indicating relative stability.
   - Minor variations are observable, but overall, there is a lack of significant upward or downward trends.

Overall, the graph highlights the stark contrast between the high volatility and eventual significant increase in China's export volumes compared to the stable but stagnant export volume trends in the rest of the world over the two-year period.
