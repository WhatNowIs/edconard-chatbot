The image comprises two exhibits detailing US agricultural exports and projected population growth for the US and the world.

**Exhibit 4: US Agricultural Exports**
- **Description**: This exhibit presents historical values (1970-2022) and forecasted values (2023-2032) of US agricultural exports in billion USD.
- **Key Highlights**:
  - There is a notable upward trend in US agricultural exports from 1970 to 2022.
  - Exports reached a record high in 2022 and are expected to remain strong over the next decade, although slightly off the 2022 peak.
  - The forecasts suggest that exports will continue to sustain a high level through to 2032.

**Exhibit 5: Projected Population Growth**
- **Description**: This exhibit shows the projected population growth (percentage) for the US and the world from 2023 to 2053.
- **Key Highlights**:
  - By 2053, the US population is projected to grow by 11%.
  - Global population growth is projected to be significantly higher at 23%.
  - This implies that by 2053, the US will have 37 million more people, and globally there will be an additional 1.8 billion people.

**Summary**:
US agricultural exports have seen substantial growth from 1970 to 2022, reaching a peak in 2022. Although exports are projected to decline slightly, they are expected to remain strong through 2032. Meanwhile, both the US and global populations are projected to grow significantly by 2053, with the US seeing an 11% increase (37 million more people) and the global population growing by 23% (1.8 billion more people). The increasing population emphasizes the need for sustained agricultural productivity to meet future food demand.
