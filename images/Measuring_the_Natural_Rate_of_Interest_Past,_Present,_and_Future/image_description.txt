The image depicts Figure 3, titled "HLW R* Estimates for the United States," which shows the estimation of the natural rate of interest (R*) over time. The graph plots two sets of estimates:
1. **Estimates based on 2019Q4 parameters** (represented by the blue line)
2. **Estimates through 2022Q4** (represented by the yellow line)

### Key Observations:
- The timespan of the graph ranges from around 1970 to 2022.
- There is a general downward trend in the R* values over this period.
- Multiple fluctuations are evident, with significant deviations in specific years, particularly visible around the early 1980s, the early 2000s, and the 2008 financial crisis.
- A noticeable divergence between the two estimates around the year 2020 suggests a change in economic conditions or modeling parameters. 
- The most recent data point shows estimates that have rebounded after a steep decline around 2020.

Overall, the chart illustrates the varying estimates of the natural rate of interest, highlighting changes in economic conditions and the model parameters used to evaluate them.
