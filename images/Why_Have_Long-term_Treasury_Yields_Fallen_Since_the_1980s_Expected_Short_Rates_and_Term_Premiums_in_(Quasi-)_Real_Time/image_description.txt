The image is a line graph comparing term premiums from three different approaches—full sample, rolling, and recursive—from January 1992 to December 2023. Key observations include:

1. **Axes and Labels**:
   - X-axis: Time, ranging from 1990 to 2023.
   - Y-axis: Term premium in percent, ranging from -3% to 4%.

2. **Lines and Legend**:
   - **Blue Line**: Full-sample term premium.
   - **Orange Line**: Rolling term premium.
   - **Yellow Line**: Recursive term premium.

3. **Trends**:
   - The full-sample term premium (blue) shows significant fluctuations, starting above 3% in 1990, dipping below 0% around 2008, and then rising and falling with noticeable peaks and troughs.
   - The rolling term premium (orange) follows a similar but slightly smoother trajectory, also showing dips and peaks, particularly noticeable around major economic events like the 2008 financial crisis.
   - The recursive term premium (yellow) appears to have the smallest range of fluctuations but still captures general trends in the premium over the years.

4. **Convergence and Divergence**:
   - Around 2008, all three term premiums converge near similar values before exhibiting divergent behaviors post-crisis.
   - In recent years (post-2020), the rolling term premium shows more variability than the other two approaches, with larger peaks and troughs.

### Summary
The graph provides a detailed comparison of term premiums using three different analytical approaches (full-sample, rolling, and recursive) over the period from January 1992 to December 2023. The term premiums demonstrate significant variation, particularly during notable economic events such as the 2008 financial crisis. While the full-sample method shows sharp fluctuations, the rolling and recursive methods offer a smoother long-term perspective, especially helpful in understanding underlying trends and patterns in the term premiums over time.
