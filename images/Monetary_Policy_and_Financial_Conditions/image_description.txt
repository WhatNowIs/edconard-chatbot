The image illustrates Figure 1 titled "Financial conditions indexes over time."

The chart plots four financial conditions indexes:
1. Bloomberg (blue line)
2. Goldman Sachs (yellow line)
3. Board FCI-G (red line)
4. Chicago Fed (green line)

The index values range from -3.5 to 1.5, covering the period from November 1, 2021, to December 31, 2023.

Key observations:
- The Bloomberg and Goldman Sachs indexes show high volatility with noticeable peaks and troughs throughout the sample period.
- The Board FCI-G index has a more stable upward-to-downward trend.
- The Chicago Fed index remains relatively steady and closely centered around zero for most of the period.

Note details:
- The Bloomberg and Goldman Sachs series are reported daily.
- The Chicago Fed index is weekly, while the Board's FCI-G is monthly.
- For comparability, the Bloomberg FCI was inverted (multiplied by -1) and 100 points were subtracted from the Goldman Sachs FCI.
- The time frame covered by the data is November 1, 2021, to December 31, 2023.
