Summary:
The cartoon illustrates the transition of people seeking relief (possibly unemployment benefits or financial aid) lining up for employment opportunities, as indicated by the "HELP WANTED" sign. The person in the suit represents an authority figure overseeing or perhaps engineering this shift from dependence on relief to active employment. The illustration underscores the movement of individuals from seeking aid to seeking jobs in the workforce.
