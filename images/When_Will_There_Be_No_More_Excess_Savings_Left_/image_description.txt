The image provides a two-axis graph illustrating the relationship between accumulated excess savings and core CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation in the US from early 2016 to early 2024. The orange line represents accumulated excess savings in billions of USD (y-axis on the left), and the blue line represents core CPI inflation on a one-year lag (annual percentage change, y-axis on the right).

Key points from the graph:

1. **Excess Savings:**
   - From early 2016 to early 2020, excess savings fluctuated around zero, experiencing minor changes.
   - Beginning in early 2020, excess savings saw a sharp increase, peaking in early 2022 at approximately 2000 billion USD.
   - After this peak, there is a steep decline, with savings falling towards zero by early 2023 and into negative territory by early 2024.

2. **Core CPI Inflation:**
   - Core CPI inflation remained relatively stable between early 2016 and early 2021, hovering around 2%.
   - Starting in early 2021, there is a noticeable rise in inflation, peaking at around 6% in late 2021/early 2022.
   - Post this peak, inflation shows a downward trend, decreasing to just above 3% by early 2024.

Summary:
The graph depicts a significant rise and subsequent decline in accumulated excess savings from early 2020 to early 2024, alongside a correlated rise and fall in core CPI inflation with a one-year lag. This data highlights the impact of economic conditions and policy responses over this period, including the potential influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent recovery phases.
