The chart illustrates the distribution of Americans' assets by income percentile over a period from 2020 to 2023. The asset categories include real estate, stocks, and pensions, and are broken down into several income percentiles:

- **Top 1% (dark green)**
- **80% to 99% (green)**
- **60% to 80% (light green)**
- **40% to 60% (beige)**
- **20% to 40% (light gray)**
- **0% to 20% (dark gray)**

Key observations from the chart:
1. The top 1% and the 80% to 99% income percentiles hold the most significant amount of assets, with the top 1% showing a noticeable increase over the time period.
2. There is a substantial increase in total assets from the beginning of 2020 to early 2023, reaching nearly $175 trillion by 2023.
3. The cumulative assets trend upwards across all percentiles but more significantly in the higher income brackets.
4. Lower income percentiles (20% to 40% and 0% to 20%) have minimal ownership of total assets and exhibit slight changes over the period.
5. The data reflects a growing disparity in asset distribution, with wealth increasingly concentrated in the top income percentiles.
