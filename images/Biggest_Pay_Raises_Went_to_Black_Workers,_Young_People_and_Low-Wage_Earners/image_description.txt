The chart titled "Wages by Earnings Level" depicts the change in usual weekly earnings from a year earlier, spanning from 2018 to 2022, and categorizes the data by three groups: Bottom 10%, Median, and Top 10%.

Key points from the chart:
1. **Bottom 10% Wage Growth**:
   - Shown with dark blue lines, the bottom 10% of earners experienced significant fluctuations.
   - Around early 2020, the growth rate dropped significantly and then rapidly increased, peaking sharply towards the end of the period (2022).

2. **Median Wage Growth**:
   - Represented by grey lines, the median earnings generally remained more stable compared to the other two categories.
   - There were modest fluctuations, with noticeable dips and rises, particularly around 2020-2021.

3. **Top 10% Wage Growth**:
   - Indicated by light blue lines, the top 10% also saw significant variations.
   - This group experienced notable declines around early 2021, followed by a recovery period, although not as sharp as the bottom 10%.

Summary:
- The bottom 10% and top 10% of earners both experienced more volatility in wage changes compared to the median earners.
- Major fluctuations for bottom and top 10% wage growth were observed around 2020-2021, likely influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic's economic impact.
- By the end of the period in 2022, the bottom 10% experienced the highest rate of wage growth among the three groups.
- Median wage growth showed relatively stable yet modest year-to-year changes throughout the observed period.
