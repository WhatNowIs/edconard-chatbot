This chart depicts the percentage of total U.S. Treasury debt outstanding held by different groups: the Federal Reserve, foreigners, and U.S. domestic investors (real money holders, banks, and households) from 1985 to approximately 2023. The data sources are FFUNDS, Haver, and the Apollo Chief Economist.

Key points:

1. **Federal Reserve**: 
   - The Federal Reserve's holdings of U.S. Treasuries remained below 20% from 1985 until around 2008.
   - Post-2008, there was a significant increase, peaking around 2020, with holdings exceeding 20%.
   - After that peak, there is a notable decline in Fed holdings, indicating the start of Quantitative Tightening (QT).

2. **Foreigners**: 
   - Foreign holdings saw a steady increase from 1985, peaking at over 50% around 2008-2010.
   - Post-2010, a gradual decline is observed, falling to approximately 35%-40% by 2023.

3. **U.S. Domestic Investors (Real Money, Banks, Households)**:
   - The share held by domestic investors declined from around 75% in 1985 to below 40% by 2010.
   - However, there is a noticeable increase starting around 2015, which continued up to 2023, where the percentage went back towards 50%.

4. **Trend Post-2008 Financial Crisis and 2020**:
   - Both the financial crisis of 2008 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused significant changes in Treasury holdings.
   - During these periods, the Federal Reserve increased its holdings to support the economy (Quantitative Easing).
   - Recent trends suggest that as the Fed reduces its holdings (Quantitative Tightening), domestic investors are purchasing more Treasuries.

Overall Summary:
The chart highlights shifts in who holds U.S. Treasury debt over the past several decades. Initially dominated by domestic investors, the landscape shifted significantly towards foreign holders and the Federal Reserve especially after key economic crises. In recent years, domestic investors are returning as key holders, aligning with the Federal Reserve's recent Quantitative Tightening measures.
