This image is a line graph comparing the performance of two different investment baskets over time: the ARK Innovation ETF and an "Old Economy" basket. The "Old Economy" basket consists of farm equipment, industrial REITs, and office cleaning supplies/uniforms.

Hereâ€™s a summary of the key points:

1. **ARK Innovation ETF:**
   - Represented by a solid brown line.
   - Initially shows steady growth, followed by a significant and rapid rise.
   - Peaks sharply at a high point, then sees a noticeable drop.
   - Continues to fluctuate with some instability towards the end of the timeline.

2. **Old Economy Basket:**
   - Represented by a dashed blue line.
   - Shows consistent, gradual growth over the entire period of the graph.
   - Does not exhibit the same level of volatility as the ARK Innovation ETF.
   - Ends at a higher level compared to its starting point, indicating steady performance.

Overall, the ARK Innovation ETF experienced both rapid growth and sharp declines, reflecting its higher volatility and risk. In contrast, the Old Economy basket maintained a steadier and more stable growth trajectory throughout the same period.
