The graph displays the percentage of US teens with major depression from 2004 to 2020, divided by gender: girls (in orange) and boys (in blue). The data shows a significant increase for both groups since 2010. Specifically, for girls, there has been a 145% increase, reaching over 25% by 2020. For boys, there's been a 161% increase, reaching about 8% by 2020. The data is sourced from the NSDUH and further details can be found in section 1.1.2 of the "Adolescent mood disorders collaborative review doc." This indicates a growing mental health crisis among US teens, with girls being more affected than boys.
