The image depicts Figure 3 titled "Productivity growth, accounting for pre-pandemic trends." The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between excess productivity growth (measured as a percentage per year, annualized) and industry teleworkability (measured in percentages).

Key Points:
- The y-axis represents excess productivity growth ranging from -25% to +10%.
- The x-axis represents industry teleworkability ranging from 0% to 100%.
- Each bubble in the scatter plot represents different industries, with the size of the bubble likely signifying the relative size or weight of the industry.
- The scatter plot shows a range of excess productivity growth rates across different levels of teleworkability.
- There is a slight positive trend line across the plot, suggesting a modest increase in excess productivity growth with higher teleworkability.
- The data source is from authors' calculations based on Dingel and Neiman (2020), the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
- The productivity growth is measured from Q4 2019 to Q1 2023, annualized. 

Summary:
The figure analyzes excess productivity growth across different industries, considering their teleworkability. It shows a slight positive correlation, highlighting that industries with higher teleworkability tend to have slightly higher annualized productivity growth post-pandemic. This insight is based on data collected from late 2019 to early 2023.
