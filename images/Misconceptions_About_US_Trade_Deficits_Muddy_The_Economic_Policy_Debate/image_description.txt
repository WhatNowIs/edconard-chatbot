The image presents a bar chart that depicts the net global current account imbalances by country group from 1986 to 2023, expressed as a percentage of the world GDP. The data is sourced from the IMF, World Economic Outlook database (April 2024), with additional data from the World Bank for China before 1997.

### Key points:

1. **Country Groups Displayed**:
    - United States (Dark Blue)
    - Oil-exporting emerging-market and developing economies (Green)
    - Japan (Orange)
    - Other high-income economies (Light Gray)
    - China (Light Blue)
    - Other East Asia (Red)
    - Rest of world (Brown)
    - Discrepancy (Black)

2. **Historical Trends**:
    - In the late 1980s, sizable imbalances are evident, with notable positive contributions from oil-exporting and developing economies, Japan, and other high-income economies.
    - Through the 1990s, the United States shows a deepening deficit while oil-exporting and developing economies, Japan, and other high-income economies continue to have surpluses or limited deficits.
    - Entering the 2000s, the US deficit peaks around the mid-2000s, with surpluses in the oil-exporting economies and China growing considerably.
    - Post-2010, the imbalances seem more moderate. The US shows deficits, but these appear somewhat lower compared to the mid-2000s. The surpluses from China and Japan are less pronounced.

3. **Specific Observations**:
    - Chinaâ€™s entry around the mid-1990s with increasing surpluses.
    - Significant discrepancies (black bars) during the global financial crisis around 2008-2009.
    - Post-2010, smaller yet persistent imbalances with notable contributions from China, oil-exporting economies, and other high-income economies.

4. **Recent Years**:
    - From 2020 onwards, the chart shows a recovery with persistent imbalances but reduced in magnitude compared to earlier decades.
    - The discrepancies have lessened, indicating possibly improved data accuracy or reporting.

### Summary:
The chart summarizes the dynamic nature of global current account imbalances over several decades. It highlights the significant role played by the United States' consistent deficits, balanced by surpluses in oil-exporting countries, other high-income economies, and more recently, China. The data indicates fluctuations with significant global economic events impacting these imbalances, such as the financial crisis of 2008. The flattening of these imbalances in recent years suggests a trend toward a more balanced global economic environment, though notable imbalances persist.
