The image features a financial chart titled "US oil and natural gas production is at record highs," sourced from the US Energy Information Administration and published by the Financial Times. The chart displays monthly production data for oil and natural gas from January 2019 to January 2023.

### Key Points:
1. **Oil Production (mn b/d)**:
   - Starting around 11.8 million barrels per day (b/d) in January 2019, peaking at about 13 million b/d in early 2020.
   - A significant drop occurred around mid-2020, bottoming near 9.7 million b/d.
   - Recovery since, with some fluctuations, and reaching around 12.8 million b/d by January 2023.

2. **Natural Gas Production (bn cf/d)**:
   - Started slightly above 90 billion cubic feet per day (cf/d) in January 2019.
   - Several peaks and troughs, with a significant dip around mid-2020 similar to oil.
   - A strong upward trend seen from early 2021, surpassing 100 billion cf/d by January 2023.

### Summary:
US oil and natural gas production saw fluctuations from 2019 to 2023, with notable drops around mid-2020 likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the industry. Both oil and gas production have since recovered and reached record highs by early 2023, demonstrating resilience and growth in the energy sector.
