The provided graph, titled "Fig. 12. Cumulative Changes in the Valuation of U.S. Treasurys," illustrates cumulative changes in Treasury values over different sets of days from 2000 to 2023.

Key Points:
1. **All Days (Blue Line)**: The cumulative change in Treasury values on all trading days shows an overall positive trend until around March 2020, followed by a decline.
2. **Other Days (Dark Gray Line)**: This line represents the cumulative change on all remaining trading days, excluding large deficit days and FOMC meeting days, also trending positively with a peak around 2020 before declining.
3. **Large Deficit Days (Red Line)**: The cumulative change on large deficit days, marked by the release of above-median CBO cost projections, shows a significant and consistent negative trend from 2000 to 2023.
4. **FOMC Meeting Days (Green Line)**: The cumulative change during the three-day window around FOMC meeting days shows a steady, albeit slight, positive increase over time.

Additional Notes:
- The gray-shaded areas indicate March 2020 and March 2022.
- The sample period for this data is from 2000 to 2023.

The graph effectively highlights how different trading days, particularly those with significant economic announcements like large deficit days and FOMC meetings, can markedly impact the cumulative valuation changes of U.S. Treasurys.
