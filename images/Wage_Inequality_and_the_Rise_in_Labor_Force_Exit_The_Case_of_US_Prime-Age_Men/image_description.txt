The image contains two line graphs illustrating trends in relative earnings and labor force exit rates for college-educated men versus non-college-educated men from 1980 to 2020. Here is a summary of the key points:

1. **Change in Relative Earnings (Panel A)**
   - **College men**: Their relative earnings have remained relatively stable over the years, showing minor fluctuations but mostly hovering around the same level.
   - **Non-college men**: Their relative earnings have significantly decreased over the same period. The decline started around 1980 and continued steadily, with the most notable decrease occurring between 1980 and 2000, leading to a substantial earnings gap when compared to their college-educated counterparts.

2. **Change in Exit Rates (Panel B)**
   - **Non-college men**: The exit rate from the labor force has increased substantially, particularly from the mid-1990s to the 2010s. This indicates that non-college-educated men are increasingly leaving the labor force over time.
   - **College men**: Their exit rates also show an upward trend but at a much slower pace compared to non-college men. The changes are relatively modest, indicating a more stable labor force participation rate for college-educated men.

**Conclusion**: Over the last four decades, non-college-educated men have experienced a marked decline in relative earnings and an increase in labor force exit rates, while college-educated men have seen relatively stable earnings and a slower increase in exit rates. This trend highlights a growing disparity based on educational attainment in both earnings and labor force participation.
