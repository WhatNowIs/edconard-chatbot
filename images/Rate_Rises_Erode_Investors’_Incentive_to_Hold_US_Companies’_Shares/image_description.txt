The chart presented compares the yields of three different financial assets from 2013 to 2023: the S&P Index earnings yield (12-month forward), US corporate investment grade bonds, and the US three-month Treasury rate. This comparison is used to illustrate why investors might be losing the incentive to own US equities.

Key Points:

1. **S&P Index Earnings Yield (12-month forward):** 
   - The blue line represents this yield, which has experienced fluctuations, peaking during economic uncertainties such as the 2020 pandemic. However, it shows a decline from its peaks and converges with the other assets' yields in recent years.

2. **US Corporate Investment Grade Bonds:**
   - The pink line indicates the yield for these bonds. After relatively stable yields from 2013 to 2020, there was a slight downtrend and then a significant increase starting from 2021. By 2023, these yields have risen considerably, narrowing their gap with the S&P Index earnings yield.

3. **US Three-Month Treasury Rate:**
   - The light blue line represents this rate, which remained low and stable until 2022, reflecting the Federal Reserveâ€™s low interest rate policy. However, there was a sharp increase in 2022, reaching levels comparable to the other assets by 2023.

Summary:
The chart demonstrates a rare compression of yields across these three asset classes, particularly near the end of the observed period (2022-2023). Traditionally, equity yields like the S&P Index earnings yield have been higher than those for treasury securities and corporate bonds, providing a premium for the higher risk associated with equities. However, the recent convergence of these yields means that safer investments, such as Treasury bills and high-grade corporate bonds, now offer comparable returns to equities. This decreased yield differential reduces the attractiveness of holding the riskier equity investments, as investors can achieve similar returns with lower risk through bonds and Treasury securities. The chart effectively illustrates why investors might be reconsidering their positions in US equities in favor of these other asset classes.
