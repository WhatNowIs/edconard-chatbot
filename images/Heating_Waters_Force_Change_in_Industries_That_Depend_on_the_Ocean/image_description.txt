The image provides information about the record-warm Atlantic sea-surface temperatures and their potential impact on increased storm formation for the season. The world map shows the average sea-surface temperature departure from historic norms for the previous 30 days (as of August 19), compared with the baseline period of 1981-2010.

Key points include:

1. **Atlantic Ocean**: The map indicates significant warming in the Atlantic Ocean, highlighted by dark red areas which indicate temperature departures of 10Â°F and higher from the historic norms.
2. **Global Sea-Surface Temperatures**: Areas across the Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and regions around Russia and northern China also show departures from historic norms, though varying in intensity.
3. **U.S. and New York**: The map denotes specific reference points such as the U.S. and New York, showing substantial warmth in waters surrounding these areas.
4. **Implications**: The record-warm temperatures are expected to fuel increased storm formation for the season.
