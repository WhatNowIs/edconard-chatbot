Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of AI exposure across wage levels for various demographic groups based on their education. The hourly wages are plotted on the horizontal axis, using a logarithmic scale and adjusted to 2020 dollars, covering the period from 2018 to 2022. Feasible AI exposure, measured as a percentage, is displayed on the vertical axis.

Key Observations:
1. The data comprises 500 demographic groups, each represented by colored markers, with size proportional to their average employment level from 2018 to 2022.
2. Color coding distinguishes educational attainment:
   - Green: Less than high school
   - Red: High school
   - Purple: Some college
   - Blue: College
   - Yellow: Postgraduate
3. AI exposure varies across wage levels, suggesting different susceptibility to automation within educational groups.

This figure helps visualize the relationship between wages, education level, and AI exposure, emphasizing how different demographics might experience the impact of AI technologies.
