The infographic titled "Braiding Quantum Information" from Quanta Magazine provides a visual guide on manipulating qubits to create a braided pattern, which maintains a memory of their past connections. Here's a summarized summary:

**Braiding Quantum Information Process:**

1. **Initial Setup**:
   Set up a grid where each qubit is connected to four neighbors.

2. **Cutting Connections**:
   A cut in the connection makes the qubits with three neighbors act as quasiparticles with unique properties.

3. **Moving Quasiparticles**:
   Move a connection to force a quasiparticle to jump to another position with only three neighbors.

4. **Creating Braids**:
   Continuously repeat the process to loop the quasiparticles around each other, effectively creating a braid.

This method of manipulating qubits can help in exploring advanced concepts in quantum information processing.
