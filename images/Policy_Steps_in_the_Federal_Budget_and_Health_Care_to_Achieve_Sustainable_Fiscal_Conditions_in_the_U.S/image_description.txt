### Summary
The projections indicate a substantial rise in healthcare spending, public debt, deficits, and interest payments as a share of GDP over the coming decades. Notably, healthcare spending (both under CMS and MPW) and debt levels (particularly under MPW) are projected to escalate significantly. Program spending for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid is also expected to increase, with Medicare showing the most significant rise. These forecasts underscore potential fiscal challenges related to healthcare and social safety net programs over the long term.
