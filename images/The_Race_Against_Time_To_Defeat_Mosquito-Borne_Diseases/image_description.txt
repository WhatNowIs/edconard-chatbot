The image shows a projection of the expansion of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes into the US and China by the year 2050, driven by environmental changes. Key points from the image are:

1. **Temporal Evolution**:
   - The change in invasion frontier boundaries is shown at 20-year intervals, specifically for the years 1950, 1970, 1990, 2010, 2030, and 2050.
   - The color gradient (light blue to dark blue) represents the expansion over the years, from early to later periods.

2. **Geographic Spread**:
   - By 2050, the projection indicates a significant expansion of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in both the US and China.
   - In the US, the affected areas are mostly the southern parts and up to the Midwest.
   - In China, the expansion is more widespread in eastern regions and parts of the interior.

3. **Regions at Risk**:
   - Other significant regions at risk include South and Central America, parts of Africa, Southeast Asia, and Australia, indicating a global spread.

4. **Climate Change Impact**:
   - The projections are based on the RCP8.5 emissions scenario, which is a high greenhouse gas concentration trajectory.
   - This signifies that climate change is a major driver of the spread and intensification of mosquito invasion.

The image emphasizes the potential health risks posed by the spread of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes under the influence of climate change, highlighting the need for global awareness and preparedness.
