The image is a graph showing the monthly illegal border encounters by demographic group along the southern U.S. land border from 2013 to 2023. The data is sourced from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and is divided into two demographic groups: "Families and children" (depicted in blue) and "Single adults" (depicted in grey).

### Key Points:
1. **Trends Over Time**:
   - There is a general upward trend in illegal border encounters for both demographic groups over the 10-year period.
   - Encounters were relatively low and stable from 2013 to 2017 but began to increase significantly from 2018 onward.

2. **Demographic Insights**:
   - **Single Adults**: The encounters involving single adults show a dramatic increase, particularly noticeable from 2020 onward, with peaks around 2021 and 2022, hitting close to or over 150,000 monthly encounters.
   - **Families and Children**: This group also shows a marked increase, especially from 2019 onward, with significant peaks around 2019 and 2022, reaching up to around 50,000 monthly encounters.

3. **Recent Trends**:
   - In the latest part of the timeline (2022-2023), both groups show high numbers, with single adults continuing to see high month-to-month variability.

### Summary:
The graph depicts a significant rise in illegal border encounters over the last decade along the southern U.S. land border, particularly since 2018. Single adults constitute the majority of these encounters, with considerable peaks observed from 2020 onward. Families and children's encounters, although lower in volume compared to single adults, still show a notable increase, peaking around 2019 and 2022. The information indicates a growing trend in border encounters involving both demographic groups in recent years.
