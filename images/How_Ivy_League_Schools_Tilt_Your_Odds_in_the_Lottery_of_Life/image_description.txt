This graph compares the outcomes of students at "Ivy Plus" schools (including the Ivy League schools and other highly prestigious institutions) with those at highly selective state flagship schools. It highlights the differences attributed to a student's own qualifications and the additional benefits of attending an Ivy League school.

The data suggests that students at Ivy Plus schools have notably better outcomes in terms of high earnings, elite graduate school attendance, and prestigious firm employment compared to their counterparts at state flagship schools. The benefits of attending an Ivy Plus school are significant even when accounting for the students' qualifications. The source of the data is a study by Raj Chetty, David J. Deming, and John N. Friedman from Brown University.
