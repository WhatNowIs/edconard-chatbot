The image presents a line chart titled "The Shrinking Low-Wage Workforce," illustrating the estimated change in employment compared to January 2020 for both overall US employment and low-wage employment (defined as earning less than $29,000 per year).

Key Points:
1. **Data Timeline**: The chart covers the period from January 2020 to January 2022.
2. **Total US Employment**: Represented by the black line, total US employment experienced a sharp decline in early 2020, likely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there was a recovery over time, overall employment remained below the January 2020 level, stabilizing at approximately -5% to -10% below the baseline.
3. **Low-Wage Employment**: Represented by the yellow line, low-wage employment also dropped significantly in early 2020. It experienced a more prolonged and severe reduction compared to total employment, stabilizing around -20% to -30% below the January 2020 level.
4. **Comparison**: The difference between total US employment and low-wage employment indicates that low-wage jobs were disproportionately affected and have been slower to recover to pre-pandemic levels.
