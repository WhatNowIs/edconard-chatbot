This chart depicts the ratio of the federal deficit to GDP from the early 1970s to around 2022. Here are some key observations:

1. **Data Range**: The horizontal axis represents years, ranging from the early 1970s to around 2022. The vertical axis shows the federal deficit as a percentage of GDP, measured in millions of domestic currency divided by four.

2. **Trend Overview**:
   - The federal deficit was relatively low and stable until the late 1970s.
   - There was an increase in the deficit in the 1980s, with notable peaks in the mid to late 1980s.
   - The 1990s saw a return to lower deficit levels, even reaching small surpluses around the late 1990s.
   - The early 2000s experienced a significant rise in the deficit once again, with a substantial downturn around 2003.
   - The late 2000s and early 2010s saw another spike, coinciding with the global financial crisis around 2008-2009.
   - Post-2010, the federal deficit's ratio to GDP fluctuated but generally remained elevated compared to pre-2000 levels.
   - There is a sharp increase in the deficit in the late 2010s and early 2020s, likely associated with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. **Notable Peaks**: Significant peaks in the ratio occur around the early 1980s, early 1990s, late 2000s, and a marked spike around 2020.

4. **COVID-19 Impact**: The most pronounced increase in the federal deficit relative to GDP is observed in the early 2020s, which could be attributed to economic measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In summary, the chart illustrates various periods of increase and stabilization in the federal deficit relative to GDP, with major spikes correlating with economic recessions and significant fiscal events like the COVID-19 pandemic.
