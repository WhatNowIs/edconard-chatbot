The bar chart "Figure 1: Share of Immigrant Contribution" provides an overview of the contributions made by immigrants in various scientific and economic categories from 1990 to 2016. The categories included in the chart are:

1. **Population** - Represents the share of immigrants in the overall population according to the American Community Survey (ACS).
2. **Inventors** - The proportion of inventors who are immigrants.
3. **Patents** - The share of patents filed by immigrant inventors.
4. **Citations** - The share of total citations attributed to immigrant-invented patents, calculated over a three-year horizon.
5. **Scaled citations** - Citations normalized by the average citations in a given technology class year.
6. **Top patents** - The proportion of top patents (defined as those in the top 10% of citations in a given technology class and year) contributed by immigrants.
7. **Market value** - The share of patent value related to immigrants, assessed based on stock market reaction to patent approval using the KPSS measure for publicly-traded and imputed private firms.

The graph reveals that immigrants, despite being a smaller percentage of the total population, contribute significantly in terms of inventorship, patenting activities, citations, and the market value of patents. For instance, their share in patents, citations, scaled citations, top patents, and market value all hover around 25%, indicating a considerable impact relative to their population share (approximately 15%).
