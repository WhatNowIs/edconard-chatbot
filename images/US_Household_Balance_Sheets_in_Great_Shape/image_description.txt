The image is a line graph titled "US household balance sheets are in excellent shape," which illustrates the ratio of US household leverage (liabilities to net wealth) over time, from Q1 1960 to Q1 2022.

Key points from the graph:

1. The ratio fluctuates over time, starting at around 10% in the early 1960s.
2. There are several peaks and troughs, notably:
   - A minor peak around the late 1970s, early 1980s.
   - A significant upward trend beginning in the mid-1990s, peaking at over 24% during the Great Recession (2007-2009).
3. Following the peak in the Great Recession, there is a marked decline in household leverage, bringing the ratio down to around 12% by Q1 2022.
4. Grey vertical bars indicate periods of economic recessions.

The general trend shows that US household leverage has significantly decreased since the Great Recession, implying an improvement in the financial health and balance sheets of US households over recent years. The data sources are FFUNDS, Haver Analytics, and Apollo Chief Economist.
