This image from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, hosted on the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) site, provides a graphical representation of labor force participation rates across two age groups: 25-54 years (depicted with a blue line) and 55 years and over (depicted with a red line).

### Key Observations:

1. **Labor Force Participation Rate for Ages 25-54 (Blue Line):**
   - Generally fluctuated between 80.0% and 81.5% from 2013 to early 2020.
   - Experienced a significant drop during the 2020 recession (highlighted by shaded area) due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - Started a steady recovery from late 2020, reaching around 83.2% by 2023.

2. **Labor Force Participation Rate for Ages 55 and Over (Red Line):**
   - Stayed relatively stable between 39.0% and 40.5% from 2013 to early 2020.
   - Also dropped sharply during the 2020 recession.
   - Unlike the 25-54 age group, the participation of this age group has seen a more volatile recovery and has remained lower than pre-recession levels, hovering around 38.4% in 2023.

### Summary:
The graph highlights the impact of the 2020 recession on labor force participation rates across different age groups, showcasing a sharp decline during the recession. The labor force participation rate for ages 25-54 has shown a more robust recovery, while the rate for ages 55 and over remains more volatile and lower than pre-recession levels.
