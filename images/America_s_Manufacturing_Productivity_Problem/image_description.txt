The image is a graph showing the contribution of capital intensity to labor productivity in various sectors of US manufacturing from around 1980 to 2020. Hereâ€™s a summary based on the information:

1. **Overall Trend**: The capital intensity to labor productivity index (with 2005 set as 100) has increased across all manufacturing sectors since the 1980s.
   
2. **Different Sectors**:
   - **All Manufacturing** (yellow line): Shows steady growth in capital intensity, especially after the early 2000s, reaching a value above 110 by 2020.
   - **Chemical Manufacturing** (purple line): Initially high in the 1980s, it shows fluctuations but overall growth towards the later years, though not as pronounced as others.
   - **Computers & Electronics Manufacturing** (teal line): Rises sharply especially after the early 2000s, reaching the highest value above 120 by 2020 among all sectors.
   - **Electrical Equipment & Appliances Manufacturing** (red line): Mirrors the trend of overall manufacturing but slightly lower.
   - **Vehicle & Parts Manufacturing** (pink line): Experiences periodic rises and falls, but shows a notable increase between 2000-2015, later stabilizing slightly above 100 by 2020.

3. **Interpretation**:
   - The graph indicates weak investment in the 2010s which has slowed the contribution of capital intensity to labor productivity growth.
   - The dramatic rise in Computers & Electronics Manufacturing suggests substantial capital investment in this sector, likely reflecting the rapid technological advancements.

4. **Data Source & Creation**:
   - The graph is created by someone named @JosephPolitano using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

In summary, while all sectors have shown growth in capital intensity since 2005, Computers & Electronics Manufacturing stands out with the most significant increase, suggesting higher investment and technological adoption in this industry. Weak investment in the 2010s has otherwise generally slowed productivity gains in other sectors.
