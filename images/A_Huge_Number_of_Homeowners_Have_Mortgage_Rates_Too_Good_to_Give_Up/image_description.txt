The image is a chart that depicts the share of existing mortgages with interest rates below or above new market rates in the U.S., spanning from around 2000 to 2023. The chart uses color gradients to indicate the percentage point difference from rates on new mortgages:

- Dark green areas show existing mortgages with rates below current market rates (with a difference of up to -3 percentage points).
- Light green to light red areas move towards mortgages with rates approximately equal to current market rates.
- Dark red areas indicate existing mortgages with rates above current market rates (with a difference of up to +3 percentage points).

Key observations:
1. The majority of existing mortgages have consistently had rates below the new market rates for most of the period from 2000 to 2020. This is indicated by the dominant green color band.
2. There are some periods where mortgages have a wider difference, either below or above the market rates, suggesting periods of significant changes in the market interest rates.
3. From around 2020 onwards, there is an increase in mortgages with rates above the new market rates, indicated by the increase in dark red shaded areas.

This chart analysis is based on data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency and covers all fixed-rate mortgages in the U.S. It reflects changes in market conditions and interest rate environments over more than two decades.
