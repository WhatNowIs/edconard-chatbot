The image is a line graph depicting the trend of US swap rates (%) over the period from 2006 to 2023, highlighted by three different types of bonds: 5-year yield, 5y5y forward yield, and 10-year yield. 

Here are the key points extracted from the graph:

1. **Rising Yields**: The title indicates that nominal yields on bonds have risen but remain at modest levels.
2. **Trend Observation**: All three yield curves (5-year, 5y5y forward, and 10-year) display substantial dips around the Great Financial Crisis (2008-2009), the subsequent European Sovereign Debt Crisis, and significant troughs around 2020 (likely due to Covid-19 impacts).
3. **Recent Increase**: There is a notable increase in yields starting around 2020 through 2023, reaching around 4%, which indicates a significant recovery from the previous lows.
4. **Comparative Performance**: The graph illustrates that while the yields on these bonds have fluctuated significantly over the years, they seem to have converged somewhat in the recent years, though differences are still observable.
5. **Data Source**: The data is sourced from the Institute of International Finance and presented by Financial Times (FT).

In summary, while bond yields have shown some increase recently, they are still at relatively modest levels compared to historical data, reflecting overall market and economic conditions.
