The image contains two charts representing financial data. The chart at the top is titled “S&P 500, cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio” and the chart at the bottom is titled “OECD countries, non-financial corporations’ earnings as % of GDP, 1995=100.”

### Summary:

1. **S&P 500, Cyclically Adjusted Price-Earnings Ratio (CAPE):**
   - Time Span: 1871 to 2024 (projected)
   - The ratio shows significant peaks around the years:
     - Early 1900s
     - 1929 (Great Depression)
     - 2000 (Dot-com bubble)
     - Post-2008 financial crisis period
   - The recent data indicates another rise nearing levels seen during the past significant peaks, approaching a ratio of 35-40.

2. **OECD Countries, Non-Financial Corporations’ Earnings as % of GDP (1995=100):**
   - Time Span: 1995 to 2023
   - The data displays two metrics: Net income and Operating income.
   - **Net Income:**
     - Shows an overall increasing trend
     - Experienced fluctuations but has risen significantly since 2015, peaking around 175% of the 1995 level.
   - **Operating Income:**
     - Displayed a steadier trend with more modest growth compared to net income.
     - Had minor fluctuations but has roughly remained around 125% of the 1995 level by 2023.

The data reflects the increasing valuation of the stock market as represented by the S&P 500's price-earnings ratio, while non-financial corporations in OECD countries have shown considerable growth in net income, outpacing operating income significantly in recent years.
