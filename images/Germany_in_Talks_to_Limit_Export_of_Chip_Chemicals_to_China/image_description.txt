The chart illustrates Germany's trade balance with China from 2000 to 2022. The data reveals a consistent trade deficit over the years, which significantly worsened in 2022. From 2000 to 2021, Germany's trade deficit with China fluctuated but generally remained within a range of approximately €10 billion to €40 billion. However, in 2022, the deficit more than doubled compared to previous years, reaching close to €90 billion. This sharp increase indicates a substantial rise in imports relative to exports between Germany and China during that year. The source of this data is Destatis.
