The image is a graph that shows the maximum temperature anomalies during the summer months (June, July, August - JJA) in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) from 1950 to 2020. The y-axis represents the temperature anomaly in degrees Celsius (°C), while the x-axis represents the years from 1950 to 2020.

Key information extracted:

1. **Title**: PNW JJA-maximum temperature anomaly.
2. **Trends**:
   - An upward trend in temperature anomalies over the years is evident, indicating increasing maximum temperatures.
   - The graph shows a significant spike in 2021, marked with a diamond symbol.
3. **Return Levels**:
   - The graph includes predictions for return levels (5-year, 100-year, and 1,000-year events) based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution.
   - The solid purple line represents the mean (μ), and the shaded areas show the intervals for return levels.
   - Dotted lines show a fit excluding the 2021 event.
4. **Significant Events**:
   - The 2021 event lies well above the predicted 1,000-year event level, highlighting an unprecedented and extreme temperature anomaly.

Summary:
The graph illustrates the increasing maximum temperature anomalies in the Pacific Northwest during the summer months from 1950 to 2020. The trend indicates a significant rise in temperatures over the decades, with 2021 marking an extraordinary peak far exceeding the 1,000-year return level prediction. This suggests that the recent temperature extremes are highly unusual and likely connected to broader climate changes.
