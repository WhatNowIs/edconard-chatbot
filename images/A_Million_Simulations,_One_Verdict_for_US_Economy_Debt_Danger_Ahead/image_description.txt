The image presents a graph showing the projected trajectory of the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio under two scenarios: 

1. **CBO Debt-to-GDP Forecasts** (black line)
2. **Adjusted for Rate Expectations** (yellow line)

**Key Observations:**
- The y-axis represents the debt-to-GDP ratio (in percentage), with increments of 50% up to 200%.
- The x-axis is a timeline from 2024 to 2050.
- The black line, representing the CBO's baseline forecast, indicates a steady climb in the debt-to-GDP ratio, reaching slightly over 150% by 2050.
- The yellow line, which adjusts for higher market interest rate expectations, shows a more pronounced increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio, projecting it could reach almost 200% by 2050.

**Summary:**
The graph illustrates the potential impact of rising interest rates on U.S. debt levels. If market expectations for higher interest rates prove correct, U.S. debt as a percentage of GDP could increase much more sharply than current Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecasts indicate. This suggests that higher interest rates could place significant stress on U.S. debt levels, leading to a more precarious fiscal situation by mid-century.
