The image provides a comparison of the age composition of the populations of Japan and China by gender for different years, illustrating a trend of population aging in both countries.

**Key Points:**

1. **Japan:**
   - In 1990, Japan had a relatively younger population with a larger percentage of people in the 0-19 and 20-39 age groups.
   - By 2010, the population structure shows a significant shift with an increase in the 40-59 and 60-79 age groups.
   - By 2020, the aging trend becomes more pronounced, with a higher percentage of the population being 60-79 years old and 80 or older.

2. **China:**
   - In 2000, China had a youthful population distribution, similar to Japan's in 1990, with larger percentages in the 0-19 and 20-39 age groups.
   - By 2021, there is a noticeable shift towards an aging population, akin to Japan's trend seen in the 2000s, with increased proportions in the 40-59 and 60-79 age groups.

**Summary:**
The image highlights the rapid aging of the populations in both Japan and China over time. Japan's population shows a clear aging trend from 1990 to 2020, while China appears to be following a similar pattern, with significant changes observable between 2000 and 2021. The data suggests that China may experience similar demographic challenges related to an aging population that Japan has been facing. This comparison indicates the importance of preparing for the socio-economic impacts of an aging society in China, following the precedent seen in Japan.
