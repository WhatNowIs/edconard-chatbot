The image is a stacked area chart titled "Select Fed Liabilities ($trn)" and shows the time period from January 2023 to January 2024. The chart displays the composition of three types of Federal Reserve liabilities: TGA (orange), Reserves (blue), and RRP (grey).

Key observations:
- The aggregate value of the three types of liabilities remains steady between approximately 5 to 6 trillion dollars throughout the depicted period.
- The majority of liabilities are composed of RRP (grey area), followed by Reserves (blue area), which constitute a significant yet secondary portion.
- The TGA (orange area) represents the smallest proportion of the total liabilities.
- There is minor fluctuation in the proportions of each component over the period, with RRP slightly decreasing and TGA slightly increasing.

The footnote mentions that reserves can move into and out of the RRP and TGA.
