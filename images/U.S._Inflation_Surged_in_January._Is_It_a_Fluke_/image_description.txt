The image presents a graph titled "Broken Transmission?" which explores the relationship between surging worker pay and labor market churn. The title suggests a potential disconnect between worker pay and labor market dynamics. 

Key Points:
1. **Graph Title and Conclusion**: The graph discusses how increased worker pay coincided with a significant rise in labor market churn. Despite the quit rate falling below pre-pandemic levels, wage growth remains significantly higher. 
2. **Metrics Tracked**: The graph measures U.S. labor market conditions using z-scores for:
   - Quit rate
   - 12m change in wages and salaries (Employment Cost Index - ECI)
   - Median 12m changes in wages
   - Month-over-month change in core Average Hourly Earnings (AHE), 3-month moving average (3mma)
3. **Time Frame**: The graph covers the years from 2001 to 2023.
4. **Trends**: 
   - Pre-2009 financial crisis: The metrics fluctuate close to the zero mark.
   - Post-2009 to pre-COVID-19 pandemic: The quit rate, wage changes, and other metrics remain relatively stable around zero.
   - Post-2020 (Post-pandemic period): There is a notable spike in wage changes (especially in the Median 12m change in wages and Month-over-month change in core AHE), while the quit rate also surged initially but has since fallen below pre-pandemic levels.

Overall, the graph highlights a significant shift in wage dynamics compared to labor market churn post-2020, suggesting a transformation in labor market behavior and wage growth mechanisms in the U.S. labor market.
