The image titled "Figure 1: Labor Share in the United States, 1929â€“2022" presents six line graphs, each illustrating different measures of labor share from 1929 to 2022. Key details from the image are as follows:

1. **Graphs and their labels**:
   - (a) "Total: Proprietors Same Share"
   - (b) "Total: Proprietors Same Wage"
   - (c) "Excluding Housing"
   - (d) "Excluding Government"
   - (e) "Government Capital Income"
   - (f) "Corporate"

2. **Graph Details**:
   - Each graph shows three lines:
     - A solid black line representing the labor share measure.
     - A dotted blue line representing the linear trend of the measure.
     - A red long-dashed line representing the Hodrick-Prescott trend of the measure, with a smoothing parameter of 100.
   - In graph (b), there is an additional short-dashed black line representing the BLS measure of the labor share for the non-farm business sector. This measure is scaled to match "Total: Proprietors Same Wage" in the first year of its observation.

3. **Labor Share Trends**:
   - In general, there has been a declining trend in the labor share across all categories since 1929, with fluctuations along the way.
   - Graphs (a) and (b) depict overall totals, while graphs (c) through (f) exclude specific sectors like housing, government, and corporate capital.

4. **Notes and Annotations**:
   - The graph (b) includes a notation indicating "BLS Non-Farm Business."
   - The trends across all graphs are visualized to highlight changes in labor share over time, with critical annotations for linear and Hodrick-Prescott trends.

**Summary**:
The figure illustrates various measures of labor share in the United States from 1929 to 2022. It highlights a general decline in labor share across different sectors, despite some fluctuations. Linear trends (blue dotted lines) and Hodrick-Prescott trends (red long-dashed lines) are used to analyze and smooth the data, showing consistent downward trajectories. The data encompasses total measures, as well as exclusions for housing, government, and focus on corporate capital income, providing a comprehensive overview of labor share trends over the long haul.
