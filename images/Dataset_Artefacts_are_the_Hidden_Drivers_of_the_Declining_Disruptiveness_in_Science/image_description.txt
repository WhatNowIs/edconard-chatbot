The figure illustrates the distribution and impact of the CD\(_5\) index on the disruptiveness of scientific papers within the SciSciNet data source, which includes 39,888,199 papers from 1944 to 2011, derived from the Microsoft Academic Graph. Here's a summary of the content:

- **Figure Panels**:
  - **Panel a**: It shows the initial distribution of the CD\(_5\) index, with notable peaks, especially one at CD\(_5\) = 1.
  - **Panel b**: Displays the corrected histogram after revealing hidden data points, unveiling that the peak at CD\(_5\) = 1 includes an additional 8,861,343 papers.
  - **Panel c**: Depicts the time evolution of the average CD\(_5\) index from 1944 to 2011. The decline in disruptiveness is evident over the years, and the impact of removing outliers (papers with CD\(_5\) = 1) and those with zero references is illustrated. The curves correspond to different methods of handling these outliers.

- **Key Observations**:
  - Papers with a CD\(_5\) index of 1 are significantly driving the observed decline in scientific disruptiveness.
  - Correcting the histogram by including these outliers substantially changes the data interpretation.
  - The average disruptiveness (CD\(_5\) index) declines less sharply over time when outliers (CD\(_5\) = 1) are removed.

This analysis suggests that hidden outliers heavily influence the perceived trends in the disruptiveness of scientific literature.
