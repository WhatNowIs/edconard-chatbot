1. **U.S. Dollar (blue line)**:
   - Has consistently maintained a high index value around 70 for the entire period from 2000 to 2022.
   - There are minor fluctuations, but it remains relatively stable.

2. **Euro (brown line)**:
   - Starts above 20 in 2000, peaks just below 30, and then declines slightly around 2010.

3. **British Pound (green line)**:
   - Fluctuates around the 10 mark with minor deviations.
   - Maintains a relatively stable value throughout the years, with no significant spikes or drops.

4. **Japanese Yen (gray dashed line)**:

The chart illustrates the relative stability of these major currencies over the two decades, with the U.S. dollar and Euro showing the most distinctive trends.
