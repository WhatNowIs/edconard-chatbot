The image is a line graph that shows generational wealth per capita, adjusted for inflation with PCEPI, and is current through the third quarter of 2023. The graph was created by Jeremy Horpedahl.

Three generational cohorts are represented in the graph:
- Baby Boomers (depicted by a yellow line)
- Generation X (depicted by a green line)
- Millennials & Gen Z (18+) (depicted by an orange line)

Here is a summary of the graph's key points:

1. Starting Point: 
   - At the median cohort age of 18, all three generations start with relatively low wealth, near $4,000.

2. Wealth Accumulation over Age: 
   - Baby Boomers and Generation X show similar patterns of wealth increase, with wealth generally rising as the median cohort age increases.
   - Millennials & Gen Z show a rapid increase in wealth in their mid-20s, surpassing previous generations at that age.

3. Peak Values:
   - Millennials & Gen Z reach a peak wealth around the median age of 30, with a value of $118,279.
   - Generation X had a notable peak around the median age of 30 (though less pronounced compared to Millennials & Gen Z) at approximately $52,752.

4. Long-Term Trends:
   - From age 40 onwards, the wealth levels of all three generations converge and follow a similar upward trajectory, approaching around $400,000 by the age of 50.

Overall, the graph illustrates how each generation has accumulated wealth over time, highlighting that Millennials & Gen Z experienced a rapid early growth in wealth, although all generations tend to converge in wealth accumulation as they approach the age of 50.
