The image displays a line graph showing the percentage change in various 'misery indexes' since the beginning of the year 2000. These indexes measure economic discomfort and are based on different mixes of inflation, unemployment, GDP, and prime lending rate metrics. The three indexes demonstrated in the graph are:

1. **Misery Index (Red Line)** - Represents the traditional measure combining inflation and unemployment rates.
2. **Hanke Misery Index (Gold Line)** - Includes additional factors such as GDP per capita growth.
3. **Oswald Index (Gray Line)** - Another variation potentially including prime lending rate.

### Key Observations:

- **2000-2010s**: All indexes show fluctuations, with a noticeable rise during the financial crisis of 2008-2009.
- **2010-2019**: The indexes remain relatively stable with minor ups and downs.
- **2020-2022**: There is a significant spike in the indexes around the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating increased economic distress.
- **Post-2020**: The indexes show a decline from their peak but remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, suggesting ongoing economic recovery issues.
