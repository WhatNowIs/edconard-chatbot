The chart illustrates U.S. birthrates per 1,000 women categorized by different age groups from 1990 to 2023, with 2023 data being provisional. Notable trends include:

- **15-19 age group**: Birthrates have significantly declined from approximately 60 births per 1,000 women in 1990 to below 10 births per 1,000 women in recent years.
  
- **20-24 age group**: Birthrates have decreased sharply from around 115 births per 1,000 women in the early 1990s to below 60 births per 1,000 women in 2023.
  
- **25-29 age group**: This group saw a decline from about 120 births per 1,000 women in the early 1990s to around 85 births per 1,000 women. There was a slight increase in the mid-2000s before continuing to decline.

- **30-34 age group**: Birthrates for this group increased slightly in the early 2000s, maintaining around 120 births per 1,000 women before gradually decreasing to approximately 95 births per 1,000 women.

- **35-39 age group**: This group experienced a gradual increase in birthrates from around 30 births per 1,000 women in 1990 to roughly 55 births per 1,000 women by 2023.

- **40-44 age group**: Birthrates rose steadily from around 5 births per 1,000 women in 1990 to approximately 15 births per 1,000 women.

Overall, the chart shows a general trend of declining birthrates among younger age groups (15-29) and a rising or stable trend among older age groups (30-44) over the past three decades. The source of the data is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
