This chart, titled "Exhibit 1: We Lowered Our Core PCE Inflation Forecast Significantly Again Today in Response to the Soft PPI Report," illustrates the percent change in Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation over a year. It compares actual inflation (solid line) with two forecasts from Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research:

1. **Current Forecast (dashed line)**
2. **Forecast as of September FOMC (dotted line)**

### Key Points:
- **Actual Core PCE Inflation** shows a consistent decline from August 2023, starting around 3.75% and decreasing to slightly above 3.00% by November 2023, then further decreasing to approximately 2.25% by May 2024.
- **Current Forecast** indicates a more substantial reduction from August 2023 (~3.50%) to around 2.25% by February 2024, eventually stabilizing around this level through November 2024.
- **Forecast as of September FOMC** shows a similar declining trend but projects a less steep decrease, with values hovering between 2.75% and 2.50% from February 2024 to November 2024.

### Summary:
Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research has significantly revised its Core PCE inflation forecast downwards, responding to a soft Producer Price Index (PPI) report. The current forecast predicts a sharper decline in Core PCE inflation, stabilizing around 2.25% by mid-2024, compared to the earlier forecast from the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) which projected a slower decline, stabilizing closer to 2.50% to 2.75%.
