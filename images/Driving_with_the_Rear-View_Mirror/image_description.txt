The chart illustrates the Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings (CAPE) ratio required over the next ten years to achieve an excess return of 11.9%, under various assumptions for real earnings growth. Key points from the chart include:

1. **Required CAPE Ratios**:
   - For a 1% assumed real earnings growth, the CAPE must rise to 61.
   - For a 3% assumed real earnings growth, the CAPE must rise to 55.
   - For a 6% assumed real earnings growth, the CAPE must rise to 51.

2. **Comparison Benchmarks**:
   - The maximum CAPE during the Tech Bubble was 44.
   - The CAPE in June 2023 was 30.
   - The postwar average CAPE is 20.

3. **Excess Returns**:
   - To achieve a 7.1% excess return over the next ten years, the required CAPE ratios are notably lower but still consistently above historical averages and the June 2023 level.

4. **Key Insight**:
   - Even with a high 6% real earnings growth assumption, achieving an 11.9% excess return would require the CAPE to rise to 51, which is higher than historical peaks, including the Tech Bubble.

5. **Source Information**:
   - The data is sourced from AQR and Robert Shillerâ€™s Data Library, spanning from January 1, 1950, to June 30, 2023.

This analysis emphasizes the substantial increase in market valuations needed to achieve historical excess returns, even under optimistic earnings growth scenarios.
