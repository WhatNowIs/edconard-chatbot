The chart, titled "Exhibit 1: Three Developments Are Set to Weigh Meaningfully on Q4 Growth," illustrates the expected impact of three significant factors on quarterly annualized GDP growth in Q4. These factors are:

1. **The Resumption of Student Loan Payments**: Expected to reduce GDP growth by approximately 0.5 percentage points.
2. **A Government Shutdown**: With a Goldman Sachs (GS) baseline assumption that the shutdown would last 2-3 weeks, the hit to GDP growth is expected to incrementally increase for each week the event lasts.
3. **A UAW (United Auto Workers) Strike**: The chart compares the potential impact to similar events in 1998, 2019, and 2007, suggesting varying degrees of negative impact depending on the duration of the strike.

The source of this data is Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research. The implication is that these three events could collectively and significantly weigh on economic growth in the fourth quarter.
