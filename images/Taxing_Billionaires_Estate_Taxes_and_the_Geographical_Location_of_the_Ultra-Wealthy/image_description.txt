The image presents Figure 8, titled "Probability of Moving between ET States and Non-ET States," and includes three panels displaying the probability trends over time for different groups within the Forbes 400 list from the years 1993 to 2009. Each panel differentiates between two probabilities: moving from an ET (Estate Tax) state to a non-ET state (blue line) and moving from a non-ET state to an ET state (red line). Key observations:

1. **Panel A (All)**
   - The blue line shows a noticeable increase in the probability of moving from ET to non-ET states, peaking around 2001-2005 and especially rising around 2009.
   - The red line remains relatively flat, indicating a low and stable probability of moving from non-ET to ET states throughout the entire period.

2. **Panel B (65 and over)**
   - There is a clear increase in the probability of older individuals moving from ET to non-ET states, particularly after 2001, with a significant rise around 2009.
   - Similar to Panel A, the probability of moving from non-ET to ET states (red line) is consistently low and stable.

3. **Panel C (Under 65)**
   - The trend is similar to Panel A, with moderate fluctuations in the probability of moving from ET to non-ET states over the years, but less pronounced compared to the older age group (Panel B).
   - The probability of moving from non-ET to ET states is again very low and stable.

**Overall Summary:** 
The data suggests that there is a trend where individuals, particularly those aged 65 and over within the Forbes 400 list, are increasingly relocating from ET states to non-ET states over the period from 1993 to 2009. In contrast, the movement from non-ET states to ET states remains consistently low across all age groups. This pattern is particularly significant in the years around 2001 and 2009.
