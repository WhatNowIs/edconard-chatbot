The image displays Figure 2 titled "Tenure outcomes with research controls", consisting of two scatter plots comparing tenure rank and tenure acquisition for individuals with different parental education levels and research controls.

**Summary:**

1. **Tenure Rank (conditional on PhD)**:
   - The x-axis measures the class gap relative to someone with a parent having a non-PhD graduate degree.
   - The y-axis categorizes by parental education level: Less than college, College, PhD.
   - Two lines are shown for each category:
        - Solid lines represent baseline data.
        - Dashed lines represent data with research controls.
   - Individuals with parents with less than a college education have a higher class gap without research controls. Research controls reduce this gap, shown by the shift of dashed lines closer to the baseline of zero, indicating that research controls diminish the observed class gaps.

2. **Got Tenure (conditional on Tenure Track institution)**:
   - The x-axis similarly measures the class gap relative to someone with a parent having a non-PhD graduate degree.
   - The y-axis categorizes by parental education level: Less than college, College, PhD.
   - Again, solid lines (baseline data) and dashed lines (with research controls) are present.
   - The observations are consistent with the tenure rank plot. Those with parents who have less than a college education have a positive gap without research controls. When research controls are applied, the gaps decrease or move closer to zero, suggesting research controls mitigate the advantage/disadvantage based on parental education.

Overall, the figure suggests that parental education influences tenure outcomes, but research controls can mitigate these effects, leveling the field for individuals from different parental education backgrounds.
