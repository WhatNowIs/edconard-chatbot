The image is a line graph comparing mortality rates for individuals aged 20 to 31 (both genders) who were born in 1990, across the USA and several Western European countries. The y-axis represents the mortality rates in deaths per 1000, and the x-axis represents age.

Key Observations:
1. The USA (represented by the blue line) has the highest mortality rates compared to the Western European countries throughout the age range of 20 to 31.
2. Western European countries, including Greece, the UK, France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Norway, are plotted with various line styles and colors.
3. Mortality rates for the USA show an increasing trend as age progresses from 20 to 31, peaking at around age 30-31.
4. Mortality rates for Western European countries remain relatively stable and significantly lower than those of the USA, with minor fluctuations.

Summary:
The graph highlights a notably higher mortality rate among young adults aged 20-31 in the USA compared to their counterparts in Western Europe. While the mortality rates in the USA increase progressively with age, Western European countries maintain much lower rates with less variation. Hence, there is a clear disparity in mortality rates between these regions, emphasizing potential differences in healthcare, lifestyle, and social factors affecting young adults.
